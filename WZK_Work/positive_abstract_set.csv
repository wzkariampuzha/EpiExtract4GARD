"Deafness, autosomal dominant nonsyndromic sensorineural 23",33962637,"<h4>Background</h4>The incidence of hydrocephalus in the spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) population relative to the general population is currently unknown. Since the approval of nusinersen, an intrathecally administered drug for SMA, a small number of hydrocephalus cases among nusinersen users have been reported. Currently, the incidence of hydrocephalus in untreated SMA patients is not available, thereby making it difficult to determine if hydrocephalus is a side effect of nusinersen or part of SMA's natural history. This retrospective, matched cohort study used electronic health records (EHRs) to estimate and compare the incidence of hydrocephalus in both SMA patients and matched non-SMA controls in the time period prior to the approval of nusinersen.<h4>Methods</h4>The U.S. Optum® de-identified EHR database contains records for approximately 100 million persons. The current study period spanned January 1, 2007-December 22, 2016. Patients with SMA were identified by one or more International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 and/or ICD-10 codes for SMA appearing as primary, admission, or discharge diagnoses, without a pregnancy diagnostic code in the 1-year time before and after the first occurrence of SMA. The first occurrence of SMA defined the index date and non-SMA controls were matched to cases. Incident cases of hydrocephalus were identified with one or more ICD-9 and/or ICD-10 code for any type of hydrocephalus following the index date. Hydrocephalus incidence rates per person-months and the incidence rate ratio comparing SMA cases with non-SMA controls were calculated.<h4>Results</h4>There were 5354 SMA cases and an equal number of matched non-SMA controls. Incident hydrocephalus events were identified in 42 SMA cases and 9 non-SMA controls. Hydrocephalus incidence rates per 100,000 person-months were 15.5 (95% CI: 11.2-20.9) among SMA cases and 3.3 (95% CI: 1.5-6.3) among non-SMA controls. The incidence rate ratio was 4.7 (95% CI: 2.4-10.2).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Based on this retrospective analysis utilizing US EHR data, SMA patients had an approximately fourfold increased risk of hydrocephalus compared with non-SMA controls in the era preceding nusinersen treatment. This study may assist in properly evaluating adverse events in nusinersen-treated SMA patients.",0.9987249970436096,True

"Methylmalonic aciduria, cblB type",33990817,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Limited data are available on the incidence of primary ophthalmic cancers worldwide. We describe the incidence and trends of primary ophthalmic cancers in Singapore.<h4>Methods</h4>Data on ophthalmic cancers diagnosed in Singapore from 1996 to 2016 were retrieved from the Singapore Cancer Registry for analysis. All were histologically proven primary ophthalmic cancers. Calculations of incidence and age-specific frequency of ophthalmic malignancy were made.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 297 cases were included, with males constituting 59.9%. The race distribution was 78.5% Chinese, 16.5% Malay, 3.7% Indians and 1.3% others. There was an overall increase in ophthalmic malignancies. The mean age of onset was 47.4 years. The most common cancers were retinoblastoma (93.3%) in patients younger than 15 years, and lymphoma (71.3%) in patients aged 15 years and older. There has been an increase in lymphomas from 16.7% in 1968-1995 to 71.3% in 1996-2016 in those aged 15 years and older. The most common types of ophthalmic cancer according to location are lymphoma of the orbit, conjunctiva, cornea and lacrimal gland; retinoblastoma of the retina; and malignant melanoma of the choroid and ciliary body.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study reported the incidence and trends of ophthalmic cancer in the Singapore population and showed an overall increase in ophthalmic malignancies in Singapore from 1996-2016. A substantial increase in lymphomas over the last 2 decades was noted. The data could aid clinicians, epidemiologists and policymakers in implementing strategies to address trends in ophthalmic cancers and spur aetiological research to improve quality of life in patients with such cancers.",0.9984153509140015,True
Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy,33712046,"Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in children, with an annual incidence of 2-20 cases per 100,000 and a prevalence of 16-150 per 100,000. It is associated with several complications that can cause short-term or long-term disability and reduce the quality of life. Among these, growth and pubertal disorders play an important role. Chronic inflammatory conditions are often associated with growth failure ranging from slight decrease in height velocity to severe forms of short stature. The prevalence of short stature in JIA varies from 10.4% in children with polyarticular disease to 41% of patients with the systemic form, while oligoarthritis is mostly associated with localized excessive bone growth of the affected limb, leading to limb dissymmetry. The pathogenesis of growth disorders is multifactorial and includes the role of chronic inflammation, long-term use of corticosteroids, undernutrition, altered body composition, delay of pubertal onset or slow pubertal progression. These factors can exert a systemic effect on the GH/IGF-1 axis and on the GnRH-gonadotropin-gonadic axis, or a local influence on the growth plate homeostasis and function. Although new therapeutic options are available to control inflammation, there are still 10-20% of patients with severe forms of the disease who show continuous growth impairment, ending in a short final stature. Moreover, delayed puberty is associated with a reduction in the peak bone mass with the possibility of concomitant or future bone fragility. Monitoring of puberty and bone health is essential for a complete health assessment of adolescents with JIA. In these patients, an assessment of the pubertal stage every 6 months from the age of 9 years is recommended. Also, linear growth should be always evaluated considering the patient's bone age. The impact of rhGH therapy in children with JIA is still unclear, but it has been shown that if rhGH is added at high dose in a low-inflammatory condition, post steroids and on biologic therapy, it is able to favor a prepubertal growth acceleration, comparable with the catch-up growth response in GH-deficient patients. Here we provide a comprehensive review of the pathogenesis of puberty and growth disorders in children with JIA, which can help the pediatrician to properly and timely assess the presence of growth and pubertal disorders in JIA patients.",0.998406708240509,True
Malonyl-CoA decarboxylase deficiency,33185984,"<h4>Aim</h4>To investigate the point prevalence of hereditary neuromuscular disorders on January 1, 2020 in Northern Norway.<h4>Methods</h4>From January 1, 1999, until January 1, 2020, we screened medical and genetic hospital records in Northern Norway for hereditary neuromuscular disorders.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 542 patients with a hereditary neuromuscular disorder living in Northern Norway, giving a point prevalence of 111.9/100,000 on January 1, 2020. The prevalence of children (<18 years old) and adults (≥18 years old) were 57.8/100,000 and 125.1/100,000, respectively. Inherited neuropathies had a prevalence of 38.8/100,000. Charcot-Marie-Tooth and hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies had a prevalence of 29.9/100,000 and 8.3/100,000, respectively. We calculated a prevalence of 3.7/100,000 for spinal muscular atrophies and 2.4/100,000 for Kennedy disease. Inherited myopathies were found in 67.7/100,000. Among these, we registered 13.4/100,000 myotonic dystrophy type 1, 6.8/100,000 myotonic dystrophy type 2, 7.3/100,000 Duchenne muscular dystrophy, 1.6/100,000 Becker muscular dystrophy, 3.7/100,000 facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, 12.8/100,000 limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, 2.5/100,000 hypokalemic periodic paralysis and 11.4/100,000 myotonia congenita.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our total prevalence was higher than previously hypothesized in European population-based studies. The prevalence was especially high for myotonia congenita and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. The prevalence of Charcot-Marie-Tooth polyneuropathy was higher than in most European studies, but lower than previously reported in epidemiological studies in other regions of Norway.",0.9983249306678772,True
Pulmonary artery coming from the aorta,19469621,"<h4>Background</h4>Many epidemiological studies have indicated that inbreeding has little or no effect on the incidence of cancer. Due to the high prevalence of consanguinity in Qatar (54%), its influence may nevertheless be of special importance.<h4>Aim</h4>The aim of this study was to examine whether parental consanguinity affects the risk of cancer in a local Arab highly inbred population.<h4>Design</h4>Matched case-control study.<h4>Setting</h4>The study was carried out in Al-Amal cancer hospital and primary health care centers in Qatar over a period from August 2008 to February 2009.<h4>Subjects and methods</h4>The study included 370 Qataris and other Arab expatriates with various types of cancers and 635 controls matched by age and ethnicity. A questionnaire that included socio-demographic information, type of consanguinity, medical history, and tumor grade was designed to collect the information of cases and controls.<h4>Results</h4>The study revealed that the rate of parental consanguinity was similar in both cases (29.5%) and controls (29.9%) with a higher inbreeding coefficient in controls (0.017-/+0.03), compared to cancer patients (0.0155-/+0.03). Other Arab expatriates had a higher incidence of cancer (61.1%) than Qataris (38.9%). The inbreeding coefficient was higher in male cancer patients (0.0189-/+0.03), but lower in female cancer patients (0.014-/+0.03) as compared to controls. Controls were more inbred in the overall studied subjects (23.6%) and women (23.8%) than cases. The coefficient of inbreeding was lower in patients with breast (0.014), skin (0.012), thyroid (0.008) and female genital (0.014) cancers, whereas it was higher in cases for leukemia and lymphoma (0.018), colorectal (0.025) and prostate (0.017), with no significant difference between cases and controls. No significant differences were observed between cases and controls in the parental consanguinity, mean coefficient of inbreeding and proportion of more inbred subjects.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The study findings revealed that although the consanguinity rate is high in our Arab population, it has no effect on the incidence of cancers overall. However, there was an increased risk found for leukemia and lymphoma, colorectal and prostate cancer groups, but a reduced risk in breast, skin, thyroid and female genital cancer groups.",0.9983099699020386,True
Familial hypersecretion of adrenal androgens,32265379,"Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection (HSV) is rare in neonates, with an estimated global incidence of 10 per 100,000 live births. Neonatal HSV is challenging to diagnose due to often vague signs and symptoms. Untreated, the mortality of some HSV subtypes exceeds 80%. Overtesting and overtreatment can result in prolonged hospitalizations and expose neonates to medication toxicity. In contrast, prompt evaluation and use of empiric antiviral therapy before the results of definitive testing can improve outcomes for infants with HSV. A wide degree of practice variation exists with respect to testing and treatment for neonatal HSV, and more research is required to safely risk-stratify this population.

Glutaric acidemia type I,33319155,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare neoplasms, with an estimated annual incidence of 6.9/100 000. They arise from cells of the diffuse endocrine system, which are mainly dispersed throughout the gastrointestinal (GI), pancreatic, and respiratory tracts. The incidence of GI-NETs has recently begun to show a steady increase. According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, 53% of patients with NETs present with localized disease, 20% with locoregional disease, and 27% with distant metastases at the time of diagnosis. Surgery is the mainstay for the treatment of locoregional GI-NETs. Endoscopic resection is an option for well-differentiated early GI-NETs, which are thought to very rarely metastasize to lymph nodes. A lesion that is technically difficult to resect via endoscopy is an indication for local resection (partial resection without lymph node dissection). GI-NETs with possible lymph node metastasis is an indication for enterectomy with lymph node dissection. For NETs with metastatic lesions, cytoreduction surgery can control hormonal hypersecretion and alleviate symptoms; therefore, cytoreduction surgery is recommended. The indications for surgery vary and are based on the organ where the NET arose; therefore, an understanding of the patient's clinical state and individualized treatment that is based on the characteristics of the patient's GI-NET is needed. This review summarizes surgical treatments of GI-NETs in each organ.",0.9982064962387085,True
Q fever,34079380,"<h4>Background</h4>Most epidemiological data on vitiligo refer to selected environments or focus on the prevalence of comorbidity unrelated to the population.<h4>Objective</h4>Aim of the study was to gain robust representative prevalence data on vitiligo and on associated dermatologic comorbidity in the German adult population.<h4>Methods</h4>A dual population-based approach was applied with 1) primary data obtained between 2004 and 2014 from dermatological exams in the general working population; 2) claims data from a large German statutory health insurance, reference year 2010.<h4>Results</h4>In the working cohort (N = 121,783; 57% male; mean age 43 years), the prevalence of vitiligo was 0.77% (0.84% in men; 0.67% in women). In the claims data (N = 1,619,678; 38% male; mean age 46 years), prevalence was 0.17% (0.14% in men; 0.18% in women). In the working cohort, vitiligo was significantly more common in people with fair skin type, ephelides and port-wine stains and less common in people with acne and solar lentigines. In the claims data, vitiligo was associated with a variety of skin conditions, eg, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis and alopecia areata.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The resulting discrepancy of claims vs primary data between 0.17% and 0.77% indicates the most probable spectrum of vitiligo prevalence in Germany. It is more frequently observed in clinical exams than recorded in claims data, indicating a marked proportion of people seeking no medical help. Such nonattendance may result from the fact that many treatment options do not provide satisfying benefits to the patients.",0.9981799125671387,True

Floating-Harbor syndrome,33722880,"<h4>Objective</h4>In observational data, lower levels of lipoprotein(a) have been associated with greater prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Whether pharmacologic lowering of lipoprotein(a) influences incident type 2 diabetes is unknown. We determined the relationship of lipoprotein(a) concentration with incident type 2 diabetes and effects of treatment with alirocumab, a PCSK9 inhibitor.<h4>Research design and methods</h4>In the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial alirocumab was compared with placebo in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Incident diabetes was determined from laboratory, medication, and adverse event data.<h4>Results</h4>Among 13,480 patients without diabetes at baseline, 1,324 developed type 2 diabetes over a median 2.7 years. Median baseline lipoprotein(a) was 21.9 mg/dL. With placebo, 10 mg/dL lower baseline lipoprotein(a) was associated with hazard ratio 1.04 (95% CI 1.02-1.06, <i>P</i> < 0.001) for incident type 2 diabetes. Alirocumab reduced lipoprotein(a) by a median 23.2% with greater absolute reductions from higher baseline levels and no overall effect on incident type 2 diabetes (hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.85-1.05). At low baseline lipoprotein(a) levels, alirocumab tended to reduce incident type 2 diabetes, while at high baseline lipoprotein(a) alirocumab tended to increase incident type 2 diabetes compared with placebo (treatment-baseline lipoprotein(a) interaction <i>P</i> = 0.006). In the alirocumab group, a 10 mg/dL decrease in lipoprotein(a) from baseline was associated with hazard ratio 1.07 (95% CI 1.03-1.12; <i>P</i> = 0.0002) for incident type 2 diabetes.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In patients with acute coronary syndrome, baseline lipoprotein(a) concentration associated inversely with incident type 2 diabetes. Alirocumab had neutral overall effect on incident type 2 diabetes. However, treatment-related reductions in lipoprotein(a), more pronounced from high baseline levels, were associated with increased risk of incident type 2 diabetes.

Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy,32564035,"<h4>Background</h4>The prevalence of perinatal infection from maternal exposure is increasing. The prevalence of acute maternal infections identifies cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19, toxoplasmosis, and varicella as the most common organisms and in the order of frequency. Maternal informed consent and understanding is required before intrauterine testing for fetal infectious and possible genetic risk assessment.<h4>Methods</h4>This structured review of the reproductive published literature focuses on the risks of amniocentesis and cordocentesis diagnostic procedure-related fetal loss rates and fetal vertical transmission (VT) rates from published infected pregnant cohorts.<h4>Results</h4>The total postprocedure fetal loss rate for diagnostic amniocentesis procedures, in limited infectious cohorts, is 1.5% and does not appear to be increased compared to ""noninfected"" amniocentesis cohorts using an estimated background spontaneous fetal loss rate (no procedure) of 0.65%. The ""pooled"" unintended fetal loss rate is from small infected population cohorts, but can be used for counseling purposes. Postcordocentesis fetal loss risk, in an infected cohort, is not possible to estimate due to limited data. The ""biological spontaneous fetal loss rate"" risk with a perinatal infection (positive or negative fetal anomalies) and no diagnostic procedure before 20 weeks of gestation is reviewed. The risk of VT in acute infection cohorts as a result of the intra-amniotic diagnostic procedure is not found to be increased.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The unintended ""fetal loss"" rate after amniocentesis for perinatal infected cohorts is similar to that of noninfected cohorts, but the estimate is based on limited infected cohorts. There was no procedure-based risk of fetal VT in the infected cohorts, but identification of postprocedure maternal bleeding into the amniotic cavity increases the potential risk. Maternal knowledge translation and an informed consent process with risk-benefit maternal/fetal risk counseling are required prior to any diagnostic amniocentesis procedure.",0.9980559349060059,True
Autosomal recessive distal renal tubular acidosis,30935721,"A molecular epidemiological study was conducted in a population of 9422 blood donors in the province of Corrientes, Northeastern Argentina, to determine the prevalence of Human T-cell lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/2), the phylogenetic identification of HTLV-1 and 2 subtypes/subgroups and perform a mutation analysis. Based on the results obtained, it was shown that both HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 are circulating in a low-risk population of Corrientes, although with a similar prevalence to that of non-endemic areas. Phylogenetic studies identified the HTLV-1 Cosmopolitan subtype Transcontinental subgroup (Aa), and the HTLV-2 subtype b. Infected donors reported neither a history of risk factors such as transfusions, intravenous drug use, nor risky or HTLV-1/2 seropositive sexual partners. These results suggest that these viruses were transmitted from mother to child, possibly from generation to generation, and that these strains were introduced into the Caucasian population of this region from ancestors originating from endemic areas of the country either from or through contact with individuals from other countries years ago. Our results demonstrate for the first time the presence of HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 in the province of Corrientes.

A total of 92 unrelated patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss were enrolled in the study. In total, 64% (59/92) of the patients were molecularly diagnosed, 44 of them in the first step by multiplex PCR plus sequencing. Exome sequencing resulted in eleven diagnoses (23%, 11/48) and four probable diagnoses (8%, 4/48) among the 48 patients who were not diagnosed in the first step. The rate of secondary findings from exome sequencing in our cohort was 3% (2/58). This research presents a molecular diagnosis spectrum of 92 non-syndromic hearing loss patients and demonstrates the benefits of using a stepwise diagnostic approach in the genetic testing of nonsyndromic hearing loss.",0.9979938268661499,True

Nephrosclerosis,32384010,"Background In this nationwide study, we used the unique Danish registries to estimate the risk of suicide and deliberate self-harm in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Methods and Results We identified all Danish citizens receiving a diagnosis of CHD between 1977 and 2007. As a reference cohort, we randomly selected 10 citizens for each patient, matched by sex and birth year. Using the Fine and Gray competing risk regression, we estimated the cumulative incidences of suicide and self-harm, and Cox proportional regression analysis was used to compare the risk of suicide and deliberate self-harm in patients with CHD with the reference cohort. We identified 14 433 patients with CHD. Mean follow-up was 21.3 years, with a maximum follow-up of 42 years. Since the time of diagnosis, 2659 patients had died, with a median age of death of 23 years. A total of 15 patients had died by suicide, compared with 232 suicides in the reference cohort. Patients with CHD had a low and similar risk of dying by suicide when compared with the reference cohort (cause-specific hazard ratio, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.48-1.37; and subhazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.41-1.16). We identified 336 events of self-harm among patients with CHD, and 3484 events in the reference group. The overall risk of deliberate self-harm was not increased in patients with CHD when compared with the reference group (subhazard ratio, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.85-1.06). Conclusions This is the first study to estimate the risk of suicide and deliberate self-harm in patients with CHD. We found that patients with CHD do not have an increased risk of suicide or deliberate self-harm when compared with a large reference cohort.",0.9979416728019714,True

The aims of this study were to estimate recent prevalences of selected birth defects and to analyze the prevalence trends of these defects during the period from 2008 to 2014. Prevalences were calculated for 69 major birth defects using health insurance claim data obtained from the Korea National Health Insurance Service (NHIS). Prevalence rate ratios were calculated using Poisson regression to analyze trends over the 7-year study period. The overall prevalence of a major birth defect was 446.3 per 10,000 births (95% CI: 444.0⁻448.6); 470.9 per 10,000 births (95% CI: 467.6⁻474.2) for males and 420.2 per 10,000 births (95% CI: 417⁻423.4) for females. The prevalence rates of the most common birth defects over the study period were; septal defect (138.2 per 10,000; 95% CI: 136.9⁻139.5), congenital hip dislocation (652 per 10,000; 95% CI: 64.1⁻65.9), and ventricular septal defect (62.62 per 10,000; 95% CI: 61.7⁻63.5). During the study period, a significant increase in the prevalence of a major birth defect was observed with a prevalence rate ratio (PRR) of 1.091. The strongest trend was observed for renal dysplasia, which had a PRR of 1.275 (95% CI: 1.211⁻1.343), and upward trends were observed for urogenital anomalies, such as, renal agenesis (PRR 1.102, 95% CI: 1.067⁻1.138), undescended testis (PRR 1.082, 95% CI: 1.072⁻1.093) and hypospadias (PRR 1.067, 95% CI: 1.044⁻1.090).

Fibromatosis multiple non ossifying,23281295,"<h4>Objective</h4>To determine the incidence, time trends, risk factors, and severity of herpes zoster in a population-based cohort of patients with newly diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared to a group of individuals without RA from the same population.<h4>Methods</h4>All residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota fulfilling for the first time the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria for RA between January 1, 1980 and December 31, 2007 and a cohort of similar residents without RA were assembled and followed by retrospective chart review until death, migration, or December 31, 2008.<h4>Results</h4>There was no difference in the presence of herpes zoster prior to the RA incidence/index date between the cohorts (P = 0.85). During followup, 84 patients with RA (rate 12.1 cases per 1,000 person-years) and 44 subjects without RA (rate 5.4 cases per 1,000 person-years) developed herpes zoster. Patients with RA were more likely to develop herpes zoster than those without RA (hazard ratio [HR] 2.4 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.7-3.5]). Herpes zoster occurred more frequently in patients diagnosed with RA more recently (HR 1.06 per year [95% CI 1.02-1.10]). Erosive disease, previous joint surgery, and use of hydroxychloroquine and corticosteroids were significantly associated with the development of herpes zoster in RA. There was no apparent association of herpes zoster with the use of methotrexate or biologic agents. Complications of herpes zoster occurred at a similar rate in both cohorts.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The incidence of herpes zoster is increased in RA and has risen in recent years. There also has been an increasing incidence of herpes zoster in more recent years in the general population. RA disease severity is associated with the development of herpes zoster.",0.9979091286659241,True
PARC syndrome,24357196,"Mandatory folic acid fortification in the United States corresponded with a decline in the prevalence of spina bifida (SB). The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiologic characteristics of isolated versus non-isolated SB cases in both pre- and post-fortification periods. SB cases in the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study from 1976 to 2011 without chromosomal anomalies and syndromes were included. A maternal interview, conducted within 6 months of delivery, collected information on demographics, reproductive history, diet, and supplement use. Daily folic acid intake in the periconceptional period was calculated using both dietary and supplement information and categorized as low intake (<400 µg/day) or high intake (≥400 µg/day). SB cases (n = 1170) were classified as isolated (80.4%) or non-isolated (19.1%). Non-isolated cases were further divided into subgroups based on accompanying major malformations (midline, renal, genital, heart, laterality). Compared to non-isolated cases, isolated cases were more likely to be white, non-Hispanic and have more than 12 years of education. Cases in the renal, genital, and heart subgroups had the lowest proportions of mothers with a high folic acid intake. The change from pre- to post-fortification was associated with a decrease in the proportion of isolated cases from 83% to 72%, though in both periods isolated cases were more likely to be female and their mothers were more likely to have high folic acid intake. These findings highlight the importance of separating isolated and non-isolated cases in etiologic research of SB.",0.9978904128074646,True
Spinocerebellar ataxia 10,33458595,"The aggressive lymphoma, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma-nasal type, is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and is most common in Asia and in South and Central America. By contrast, incidence is low in the United States and Europe, where extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma represents only 0.2%-0.4% of all newly diagnosed non-Hodgkin lymphomas. At diagnosis, it is important to test for EBV DNA in plasma by polymerase chain reaction and to carry out positron emission tomography/computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the nasopharynx. In stage I/II disease, radiotherapy is the most important treatment modality, but in high-risk stage I/II disease (stage II, age > 60 y, elevated lactate dehydrogenase, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score ≥2, primary tumor invasion), it should be combined with chemotherapy. The most optimal responses are reached with nonmultidrug resistance-based therapy (eg, asparaginase- or platinum-based therapy). Therapeutic approaches consist of either platinum-based concurrent chemoradiotherapy or sequential chemoradiotherapy. The minimum dose of radiotherapy should be 50-56 Gy. Treatment of stage III/IV disease consists of 3 cycles of chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation. Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation should only be considered in case of relapsed disease or after difficulty reaching complete remission. During treatment and follow-up, plasma EBV levels should be monitored as a marker of tumor load.",0.9978795051574707,True
Giant platelet syndrome,33257956,"The temperate United States has experienced increasing incidence of mosquito-borne diseases. Recent studies conducted in Baltimore, MD have demonstrated a negative relationship between abundances of Aedes albopictus (Skuse) and Culex mosquitoes and mean neighborhood income level, but have not looked at the presence of pathogens. Mosquitoes collected from five socioeconomically variable neighborhoods were tested for infection by West Nile, chikungunya, and Zika viruses in 2015 and 2016, and again from four of the neighborhoods in 2017. Minimum infection rates of pooled samples were compared among neighborhoods for each year, as well as among individual blocks in 2017. West Nile virus was detected in both Ae. albopictus and Culex pools from all neighborhoods sampled in 2015 and 2017. No infected pools were detected in any year for chikungunya or Zika viruses, and none of the target viruses were detected in 2016. Infection rates were consistently higher for Culex than for Ae. albopictus. Minimum infection rate was negatively associated with mean neighborhood income for both species in 2015. Although earlier work has shown a positive association between block-level abandonment and mosquito abundance, no association was detected in this study. Still, we demonstrate that viral infection in mosquito pools can differ substantially across adjacent urban neighborhoods that vary by income. Though trap security and accessibility often inform city sampling locations, detecting and managing arboviral risk requires surveillance across neighborhoods that vary in socioeconomics, including lower income areas that may be less accessible and secure but have higher infection rates.",0.9978748559951782,True
King Denborough syndrome,32729070,"<h4>Purpose of review</h4>The global prevalence of obesity has increased rapidly over the last decades, posing a severe threat to human health. Currently, bariatric surgery is the most effective therapy for patients with morbid obesity. It is unknown whether this treatment is also suitable for patients with obesity due to a confirmed genetic defect (genetic obesity disorders). Therefore, this review aims to elucidate the role of bariatric surgery in the treatment of genetic obesity.<h4>Recent findings</h4>In monogenic non-syndromic obesity, an underlying genetic defect seems to be the most important factor determining the efficacy of bariatric surgery. In syndromic obesity, bariatric surgery result data are scarce, and even though some promising follow-up results have been reported, caution is required as patients with more severe behavioral and developmental disorders might have poorer outcomes. There is limited evidence in support of bariatric surgery as a treatment option for genetic obesity disorders; hence, no strong statements can be made regarding the efficacy and safety of these procedures for these patients. However, considering that patients with genetic obesity often present with life-threatening obesity-related comorbidities, we believe that bariatric surgery could be considered a last-resort treatment option in selected patients.",0.9978700876235962,True

Ringed hair disease,26973535,"Isolated cleft palate (CPO) is the rarest form of oral clefting. The incidence of CPO varies substantially by geography from 1.3 to 25.3 per 10,000 live births, with the highest rates in British Columbia, Canada and the lowest rates in Nigeria, Africa. Stratified by ethnicity/race, the highest rates of CPO are observed in non-Hispanic Whites and the lowest in Africans; nevertheless, rates of CPO are consistently higher in females compared to males. Approximately fifty percent of cases born with cleft palate occur as part of a known genetic syndrome or with another malformation (e.g., congenital heart defects) and the other half occur as solitary defects, referred to often as non-syndromic clefts. The etiology of CPO is multifactorial involving genetic and environmental risk factors. Several animal models have yielded insight into the molecular pathways responsible for proper closure of the palate, including the BMP, TGF-β, and SHH signaling pathways. In terms of environmental exposures, only maternal tobacco smoke has been found to be strongly associated with CPO. Some studies have suggested that maternal glucocorticoid exposure may also be important. Clearly, there is a need for larger epidemiologic studies to further investigate both genetic and environmental risk factors and gene-environment interactions. In terms of treatment, there is a need for long-term comprehensive care including surgical, dental and speech pathology.

PGM3-CDG,32333971,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Determine the types, incidence, mortality rate, and clinical status of youth diabetes at Bach Christian Hospital (BCH), Qalandarabad, Pakistan.<h4>Methods</h4>Analysis of incidence and mortality data of all patients (<25 year (y)) diagnosed from January 2014-June 2019, and also analysis of clinical status of patients < 25y seen in 2018/2019.<h4>Results</h4>Ninety-three patients were seen over the study period. Eighty-eight were type 1 diabetes (T1D), 51.1% female. Age of diagnosis was 0.8-24.5 years (y) (mean = 11.4 y, SD = 6.2y). 15.1% were 0-4y, 31.4% 5-9 y, 24.4% 10-14y, 19.8% 15-19y, and 9.3% 20-24y. Minimum incidence for the Mansehra tehsil administrative district was calculated as 1.0 per 100,000 population <15y/y, 1.2 per 100,000 < 20y/y and 1.1 per 100,000 < 25y/y; the degree of ascertainment could not be assessed. A further four patients were diagnosed with thiamine-responsive megaloblastic anaemia (TRMA), all male, three from the same consanguineous family, and were treated with high-dose thiamine. One other patient was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Three T1D and one TRMA patient died during the study period. The standardised mortality rate for T1D was 9.4, but vital status was unknown for 13 patients. The mean/median HbA1c of T1D patients seen in 2018/2019 was 9.1%/9.2% (76/77 mmol/mol).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Minimum T1D incidence in Mansehra tehsil is double the previously reported value for Pakistan (from 1990 to 1999), although is still low compared to most other countries. Considering the limited resources available, patients attending BCH are achieving fair glycemic control.

Seventy-nine patients (59 having classic SMS, 19 having partial SMS, and 1 having progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus [PERM]) were GAD65 antibody seropositive. Sixty-seven percent (53 of 79) of them had at least 1 coexisting autoimmune disease, and 4% (3 of 79) had cancer. GAD65 antibody values at initial evaluation were significantly higher among patients with classic SMS (median value, 623 nmol/L) than among patients with partial SMS (median value, 163 nmol/L) (P < .001). The initial GAD65 antibody value was positively correlated with the last follow-up Rankin score (P = .03). Among 20 patients who were GAD65 antibody seronegative (6 with classic SMS, 12 with partial SMS, and 2 with PERM), 15% (3 of 20) had at least 1 coexisting autoimmune disease, and 25% (5 of 20) had cancer (3 with amphiphysin autoimmunity and breast carcinoma and 2 with Hodgkin lymphoma). Excluding patients with PERM, all patients but 1 had sustained improvements with at least 1 γ-aminobutyric acid agent, usually diazepam; the median dosage for patients with classic SMS was 40.0 mg/d. Additional improvements occurred among 14 of 34 patients (41%) who received immunotherapy (intravenous immune globulin, azathioprine, prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclophosphamide). Sixteen of 25 patients (64%) with extended follow-up duration remained ambulatory.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Recognition of classic SMS vs variants is important because appropriate therapy improves symptoms in most patients.

Familial cerebral cavernous malformation,32742426,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Our goal was to assess the prevalence of ipsilateral distal femoral osteochondritis dissecans (OCD)-like lesions in children with Blount disease, including factors associated with this finding.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Characteristics of patients with an OCD-like lesion on an imaging study [(X-ray and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] were compared with those without such a finding.<h4>Results</h4>Over a 12-year period, 6/63 (10%) skeletally immature patients (9/87 limbs) with Blount disease had an OCD-like lesion visible on plain radiographs. Based on available MRI, 7/37 (19%) patients or 10/53 (19%) limbs had an OCD-like distal femoral lesion. All lesions were noted in the posterior third of the weight-bearing portion of the medial femoral condyle with intact overlying articular cartilage. All patients with OCD-like lesions were followed for an average of 1.9 years (range: 1-2.6 years), and complete radiographic resolution of lesion was noted in 7/9 limbs (78%). There was no association of the presence of OCD-like lesion with early- vs late-onset disease, gender, age at imaging, laterality, magnitude of deformity [mean mechanical axis deviation (MAD) 63.3 vs 71.9 mm], mean mechanical lateral distal femoral angle (mLDFA; 91.3 vs 89.7°), and mean medial proximal tibial angle (MPTA; 71.7 vs 71.8°). Children with an OCD-like lesion tended to have a lower mean body mass index (BMI; 21 vs 36, <i>p</i> = 0.003).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The overall prevalence of OCD-like lesions in the medial femoral condyle in children with Blount disease lesions is 10% using plain radiographs and at least 19% on MRI. Based on the numbers available, we were unable to demonstrate any associations between the presence of such lesions and the patient's age, gender, or magnitude of varus deformity.

The Southeast Asia region is home to many wasted children, but wasting is not recognized as a public health problem and its epidemiology is yet to be fully examined. This analysis aimed to determine the burden of wasting, its predictors, and the level of wasting and stunting concurrence. Datasets from Demographic and Health Surveys and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys in six countries in the region were analyzed. The pooled weighted prevalence for wasting and concurrent wasting and stunting among children 0-59 months in the six countries was 8.9%, 95% CI (8.0-9.9) and 1.6%, 95% CI (1.5-1.8), respectively. This prevalence is approximately 12-fold higher than the 0.7% prevalence of high-income countries; and translated into an absolute number of 1,088,747 children affected by wasting and 272,563 concurrent wasting and stunting. Wasting prevalence was 50 percent higher in the 0-23-month age group.

Dandy-Walker malformation with sagittal craniosynostosis and hydrocephalus,30566429,"BACKGROUND:The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of fractures in infancy, overall and by type of fracture, its association with accidents, metabolic bone disease risk factors, and abuse diagnosis. METHODS:The design was a population-based register study in Sweden. Participants: Children born 1997-2014, 0-1 years of age diagnosed with fracture-diagnosis according to International Classification of Diseases (ICD10) were retrieved from the National Patient Register and linked to the Swedish Medical Birth Register and the Death Cause Register. Main outcome measures were fractures of the skull, long bone, clavicle and ribs, categorized by age (younger or older than 6 months), and accident or not. FINDINGS:The incidence of fractures during infancy was 251 per 100 000 infants (n = 4663). Major fracture localisations were long bone (44·9%), skull (31·7%), and clavicle (18·6%), while rib fractures were few (1·4%). Fall accidents were reported among 71·4%. One-third occurred during the first 6 months. Metabolic bone disease risk factors, such as maternal obesity, preterm birth, vitamin D deficiency, rickets, and calcium metabolic disturbances, had increased odds of fractures of long bones and ribs in early infancy (0-6 months): birth 32-36 weeks and long bone fracture [AOR 2·13 (95%CI 1·67-2·93)] and rib fracture [AOR 4·24 (95%CI 1·40-12·8)]. Diagnosis of vitamin D deficiency/rickets/disorders of calcium metabolism had increased odds of long bone fracture [AOR 49·5 (95%CI 18·3-134)] and rib fracture [AOR 617 (95%CI 162-2506)]. Fractures without a reported accident had higher odds of metabolic risk factors than those with reported accidents. Abuse diagnosis was registered in 105 infants, with overrepresentation of preterm births, multiple births and small-for-gestational age. INTERPRETATION:Metabolic bone disease risk factors are strongly associated with fractures of long bone and ribs in early infancy.

VACTERL association,34095035,"This study is to describe current incidence of childhood clear cell sarcoma of kidney (CCSK) and to investigate the present survival of this cancer. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result (SEER) data was used to identify children with CCSK and Wilms tumor (WT) aged 0-19 years in the US. Age-adjusted incidences were estimated over the decades. Age- and sex-specific epidemiology was also presented. Propensity score matching was used to balance features of CCSK and WT cases. Log rank test was used to compare survivals and Cox regression was used to evaluate independent effects of factors. The present age-adjusted incidence of childhood CCSK was 0.205 per million, which remained stable for years and ranked third in all pediatric renal tumors. The incidence rate ratios for boy and age under 4 were 3 and 21, respectively. The current 5-year overall survival (OS) rate for CCSK was 87%, which is not evidently inferior to that for WT (90%); however the outcome of CCSK was significantly poorer if both groups were well-balanced (OS rate was 86 vs. 95%). Early year of diagnosis and distant metastasis were independent survival factors. In conclusion, occurrence of CCSK remains stable over the years, with an age-adjusted incidence of 0.205 per million. Boy and age under 4 are risk factors for tumor development. CCSK currently has a favorable outcome but its nature may be more aggressive than common kidney tumor, which in turn proves efficacy of modern treatment.",0.9975066781044006,True

OPA1 mutations are found in 70% of DOA patients, with a significant number remaining undiagnosed.<h4>Methods</h4>We screened 286 index cases presenting optic atrophy, negative for OPA1 mutations, by targeted next generation sequencing or whole exome sequencing. Pathogenicity and molecular mechanisms of the identified variants were studied in yeast and patient-derived fibroblasts.<h4>Results</h4>Twelve cases (4%) were found to carry novel variants in AFG3L2, a gene that has been associated with autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 28 (SCA28). Half of cases were familial with a dominant inheritance, whereas the others were sporadic, including de novo mutations. Biallelic mutations were found in 3 probands with severe syndromic optic neuropathy, acting as recessive or phenotype-modifier variants. All the DOA-associated AFG3L2 mutations were clustered in the ATPase domain, whereas SCA28-associated mutations mostly affect the proteolytic domain. The pathogenic role of DOA-associated AFG3L2 mutations was confirmed in yeast, unraveling a mechanism distinct from that of SCA28-associated AFG3L2 mutations. Patients' fibroblasts showed abnormal OPA1 processing, with accumulation of the fission-inducing short forms leading to mitochondrial network fragmentation, not observed in SCA28 patients' cells.<h4>Interpretation</h4>This study demonstrates that mutations in AFG3L2 are a relevant cause of optic neuropathy, broadening the spectrum of clinical manifestations and genetic mechanisms associated with AFG3L2 mutations, and underscores the pivotal role of OPA1 and its processing in the pathogenesis of DOA.

Lung adenocarcinoma,33649778,"Uveal melanoma (UM) represents the most prominent primary eye cancer in adults. With an incidence of approximately 5 cases per million individuals annually in the United States, UM could be considered a relatively rare cancer. The 90‑95% of UM cases arise from the choroid. Diagnosis is based mainly on a clinical examination and ancillary tests, with ocular ultrasonography being of greatest value. Differential diagnosis can prove challenging in the case of indeterminate choroidal lesions and, sometimes, monitoring for documented growth may be the proper approach. Fine needle aspiration biopsy tends to be performed with a prognostic purpose, often in combination with radiotherapy. Gene expression profiling has allowed for the grading of UMs into two classes, which feature different metastatic risks. Patients with UM require a specialized multidisciplinary management. Primary tumor treatment can be either enucleation or globe preserving. Usually, enucleation is reserved for larger tumors, while radiotherapy is preferred for small/medium melanomas. The prognosis is unfavorable due to the high mortality rate and high tendency to metastasize. Following the development of metastatic disease, the mortality rate increases to 80% within one year, due to both the absence of an effective treatment and the aggressiveness of the condition. Novel molecular studies have allowed for a better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms involved in UM biological activity, which differs compared to skin melanomas. The most commonly mutated genes are GNAQ, GNA11 and BAP1. Research in this field could help to identify effective diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, as well as novel therapeutic targets.",0.9974766373634338,True
Neuroectodermal endocrine syndrome,33806811,"<i>Background and Objectives</i>: The incidence of diverticulitis is increasing in western countries. Complicated diverticulitis is defined as diverticulitis associated with localized or generalized perforation, localized or distant abscess, fistula, stricture or obstruction. Colonic symptomatic strictures are often treated with segmental colectomy. The aim of our study is to report our experience with Self Expandable Metal Stents (SEMS) placement to relieve sigmoid obstruction secondary to diverticulitis, either as a permanent solution or as a bridge to elective colectomy. <i>Material and Methods</i>: From January 2016 to December 2018, 21 patients underwent SEMS placement for sigmoid obstruction secondary to diverticulitis at our institution. In four patients with poor general conditions, SEMS was considered the definitive form of treatment. In 17 patients, the stent was placed as bridge to elective colectomy. Data were prospectively collected and retrospectively analyzed. Primary outcomes were postoperative mortality and morbidity after SEMS and subsequent elective colectomy. <i>Results</i>: There was no mortality or major morbidity after SEMS placement or subsequent elective colectomy. No stoma was performed. <i>Conclusions</i>: Placement of Colorectal Self Expandable Stent represents a useful tool to relieve obstruction in patients with left-sided colonic diverticulitis. SEMS placement makes it possible to transform an emergency clinical condition into an elective condition, giving time to resolve the inflammation and the infection inevitably associated with complicated diverticulitis.",0.9974724650382996,True
Neutrophil-specific granule deficiency,34002664,"Testicular cancer is the most common malignant tumor in young men, and its incidence has increased in recent years. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a crucial role in the development and progression of tumors; however, the TME of testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) is poorly understood. In this study, we downloaded information for 156 TGCT cases from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, used the ESTIMATE method to determine immune and stromal scores, and used CIBERSORT to calculate the proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells (TICs). The differentially expressed genes were subjected to a COX regression analysis and used for the construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) was identified as a predictive marker by combining the results of the Cox regression analysis and PPI network. A survival analysis showed that TLR2 was positively correlated with TGCT survival. A gene set enrichment analysis indicated that genes in the high TLR2 expression group were enriched for cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) and the chemokine signaling pathway, and genes in the low TLR2 expression group were mainly enriched in the spliceosome. Regarding proportions of TICs, naive B cells and follicular helper T cells were negatively correlated with the expression of TLR2. This suggests that as TLR2 expression increases, the immunocompetence of the TME decreases. The expression of TLR2 may affect the prognosis of TGCT, suggesting that this locus can be used as a prognostic factor for TGCT.",0.9974710941314697,True
Biliary tract cancer,33847152,"Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most prevalent autoimmune blistering skin disease in the Western world affecting mainly the elderly population. The diagnosis is based on clinical assessment along with specific immunopathologic findings on skin biopsy. Risk factors include genetic factors, environmental exposures, and several infections including hepatitis B, hepatitis C, <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>, <i>Toxoplasma gondi</i>, and cytomegalovirus. A variety of drugs have been associated with BP including but not limited to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, loop diuretics, spironolactone, and neuroleptics. Associated neurologic disorders (dementia, Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, previous stroke history, and multiple sclerosis) have also been described. Common clinical presentation consists of extremely pruritic inflammatory plaques that resemble eczematous dermatitis or urticaria, followed by formation of tense bullae with subsequent erosions. Typical distribution involves the trunk and extremities. Mucosa is typically spared affecting only 10% to 30% of patients. Several unusual clinical presentations of BP have been described such as nonbullous forms with erythematous excoriated papules, plaques, and nodules. Other reported findings include urticarial lesions, prurigo-like nodules, multiple small vesicles resembling dermatitis herpetiformis or pompholyx, vegetating and purulent lesions localized in intertriginous areas, and even exfoliative erythroderma. Recognition and management of such cases can present a diagnostic challenge to clinicians. In this article, we describe another variant which to our knowledge is the first case to present with a cellulitis-like presentation in a patient with a known history of BP.",0.9974607229232788,True
Halal syndrome,34092257,"The prevalence of congenital hydrocephalus has been estimated at 1.1 per 1000 infants when including cases diagnosed before 1 year of age after exclusion of neural tube defects. Classification criteria are based either on CSF dynamics, pathophysiological mechanisms or associated lesions. Whereas inherited syndromic hydrocephalus has been associated with more than 100 disease-causing genes, only four genes are currently known to be linked to congenital hydrocephalus either isolated or as a major clinical feature: L1CAM, AP1S2, MPDZ and CCDC88C. In the past 10 years, pathogenic variants in CCDC88C have been documented but the neuropathology remains virtually unknown. We report the neuropathology of two foetuses from one family harbouring two novel compound heterozygous pathogenic variants in the CCDC88C gene: a maternally inherited indel in exon 22, c.3807_3809delinsACCT;p.(Gly1270Profs*53) and a paternally inherited deletion of exon 23, c.3967-?_c.4112-?;p.(Leu1323Argfs*10). Medical termination of pregnancy was performed at 18 and 23 weeks of gestation for severe bilateral ventriculomegaly. In both fetuses, brain lesions consisted of multifocal atresia-forking along the aqueduct of Sylvius and the central canal of the medulla, periventricular neuronal heterotopias and choroid plexus hydrops. The second fetus also presented lumbar myelomeningocele, left diaphragmatic hernia and bilateral renal agenesis. CCDC88C encodes the protein DAPLE which contributes to ependymal cell planar polarity by inhibiting the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway and interacts with MPDZ and PARD3. Interestingly, heterozygous variants in PARD3 result in neural tube defects by defective tight junction formation and polarization process of the neuroepithelium. Besides, during organ formation Wnt signalling is a prerequisite for planar cell polarity pathway activation, and mutations in planar cell polarity genes lead to heart, lung and kidney malformations. Hence, candidate variants in CCDC88C should be carefully considered whether brain lesions are isolated or associated with malformations suspected to result from disorders of planar cell polarity.",0.9974585175514221,True
Hurler syndrome,30363785,"Orthostatic tremor is a rare condition, though its exact prevalence is unknown, which is clinically characterized by a feeling of unsteadiness or being about to fall on standing and which disappears on walking, sitting, or lying down. It is generally accepted that classic orthostatic tremor manifests with a high-frequency tremor (>13 Hz) of the legs when standing. However, a number of patients initially reported as orthostatic tremor did not actually have such electrophysiological features. It is our experience that there is a clinical spectrum of different conditions presenting as shaking on standing, and this highlights the importance of the electrophysiology to aid the differential diagnosis of these disorders. Here, we provide a critical review of the clinical spectrum of shaking on standing, along with demonstrative electrophysiological recordings of some of these conditions.",0.9974488615989685,True
Familial hypersecretion of adrenal androgens,31570510,"OBJECTIVES:The incidence of neonatal herpes simplex virus (nHSV) infections is monitored periodically in the Netherlands, yet management and outcome is unknown. Comprehensive national guidelines are lacking. We aim to describe management and outcome in the last decade to explore current diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We aim to identify possible variability in management of patients with a suspected nHSV infection. METHODS:We conducted a retrospective case series of management and outcome of nHSV infections at 2 tertiary care center locations in the Netherlands. RESULTS:An nHSV infection was diagnosed in 1% (12 of 1348) of patients in whom polymerase chain reaction for HSV was performed. Of the patients with nHSV infection, 3 of 12 died, and 4 of 9 (44%) survivors suffered neurologic sequelae. Neurologic symptoms at presentation were seen in only 2 of 8 patients with nHSV encephalitis. A cerebral spinal fluid analysis was performed in 3 of 6 patients presenting with skin lesions. Only 3 of 6 patients with neurologic symptoms received suppressive therapy. nHSV infection was diagnosed in 8 of 189 (4%) patients who were empirically treated. CONCLUSIONS:Management of nHSV infection, particularly when presented with skin lesions, is inconsistent. Many infants without a HSV infection are exposed to antiviral medication. There is substantial interhospital variation in diagnostic and therapeutic management of a suspected infection. Comprehensive guidelines need to be developed to standardize management of suspected nHSV infection.",0.9974368810653687,True
Oculomotor apraxia Cogan type,31805893,"BACKGROUND:The incidence of Taralomyces marneffei infection in HIV-infected individuals has been decreasing, whereas its rate is rising among non-HIV immunodeficient persons, particularly patients with anti-interferon-gamma autoantibodies. T. marneffei usually causes invasive and disseminated infections, including fungemia. T. marneffei oro-pharyngo-laryngitis is an unusual manifestation of talaromycosis. CASE PRESENTATION:A 52-year-old Thai woman had been diagnosed anti-IFNɣ autoantibodies for 4 years. She had a sore throat, odynophagia, and hoarseness for 3 weeks. She also had febrile symptoms and lost 5 kg in weight. Physical examination revealed marked swelling and hyperemia of both sides of the tonsils, the uvula and palatal arches including a swelling of the epiglottis, and arytenoid. The right tonsillar biopsy exhibited a few intracellular oval and elongated yeast-like organisms with some central transverse septum seen, which subsequently grew a few colonies of T. marneffei on fungal cultures. The patient received amphotericin B deoxycholate 45 mg/dayfor 1 weeks, followed by oral itraconazole 400 mg/day for several months. Her symptoms completely resolved without complication. CONCLUSION:In patients with anti-IFN-ɣ autoantibodies, T. marneffei can rarely cause a local infection involving oropharynx and larynx. Fungal culture and pathological examination are warranted for diagnosis T. marneffei oro-pharyngo-laryngitis. This condition requires a long term antifungal therapy.",0.9974308609962463,True
Baby rattle pelvic dysplasia,34160789,"The escalating prevalence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide, with an increased rate of morbidity and mortality, highlights an urgent need to develop more effective therapeutic interventions. Despite the authorized treatment against COVID-19 by the European Union (EU), the safety and effectiveness of this therapeutic strategy for a wide variety of patients have remained a significant challenge. In this respect, micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals, as essential factors, can be considered for improving the function of the immune system and accelerating the treatment procedure. Dietary supplements can attenuate vascular and inflammatory manifestations related to infectious diseases in large part due to their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Recently, it has been revealed that poor nutritional status may be one of the notable risk factors in severe COVID-19 infections. In the current review, we focus on the micronutrient therapy of COVID-19 patients and provide a comprehensive insight into the essential vitamins/minerals and their role in controlling the severity of the COVID-19 infection.

Morquio syndrome B,33348463,"<h4>Background</h4>Down syndrome is the most common chromosomal disorder at birth and is often accompanied by structural birth defects. Current data on major structural defects in this population are limited.<h4>Methods</h4>States and territorial population-based surveillance programs submitted data on identified cases of Down syndrome and identified structural birth defects during 2013-2017. We estimated prevalence by program type and maternal and infant characteristics. Among programs with active case ascertainment, we estimated the prevalence of birth defects by organ system and for specific defects by maternal age (<35, ≥35) and infant sex.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 13,376 cases of Down syndrome. Prevalence among all programs was 12.7 per 10,000 live births. Among these children, 75% had at least one reported co-occurring birth defect diagnosis code. Among 6,210 cases identified by active programs, 66% had a cardiovascular defect with septal defects being the most common: atrial (32.5%), ventricular (20.6%), and atrioventricular (17.4%). Defect prevalence differed by infant sex more frequently than by maternal age. For example, atrioventricular septal defects were more common in female children (20.1% vs. 15.1%) while limb deficiencies were more prevalent in male children (0.4% vs. 0.1%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study provides updated prevalence estimates for structural defects, including rare defects, among children with Down syndrome using one of the largest and most recent cohorts to date.

Secondary objectives were to assess the prevalence of other sleep disorders and the frequency of diagnostic sleep testing.<h4>Methods</h4>Nationwide medical/prescription claims (Symphony Health) were analyzed to estimate the annual prevalence per 100,000 persons of narcolepsy and other sleep disorders (obstructive sleep apnea, idiopathic hypersomnia, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, periodic limb movement disorder) and the frequency of diagnostic sleep testing. Prevalence was adjusted to the age/sex distribution of the 2016 US census estimates.<h4>Results</h4>The prevalence of narcolepsy per 100,000 persons increased 14% from 38.9 in 2013 to 44.3 in 2016. Obstructive sleep apnea prevalence increased 41% over the study period from 2,429 to 3,420 per 100,000. Large increases in prevalence were also seen for idiopathic hypersomnia (32%), periodic limb movement disorder (30%), and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (64%). For each sleep disorder, prevalence was higher for those with commercial insurance versus Medicare/Medicaid, and markedly lower prevalence was observed for the Northeast compared with the Midwest, South, and Western US regions. The frequency of multiple sleep latency/maintenance of wakefulness testing declined by 20%, and polysomnography declined by 15%. Conversely, home sleep apnea testing increased by 117%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prevalence of narcolepsy, obstructive sleep apnea, and the other sleep disorders increased appreciably over the 2013-2016 period.

Schrander-Stumpel Theunissen Hulsmans syndrome,33309585,"<h4>Introduction</h4>21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) is the most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). In adulthood, most studies are reported in females. By contrast, data on adult males are scarce.<h4>Objective</h4>To describe a series of adult males with classic 21-OHD and to assess the presence of adrenal masses and testicular adrenal rest tumors (TARTs).<h4>Material and methods</h4>Eight males (21-42 years) were included. We evaluated clinical presentation, 17-Hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP), Testosterone (T), Δ4Androstenedione (Δ4A) ACTH, LH, FSH and plasma renin activitiy (PRA) levels at consultation. Molecular studies of the CYP21A2 gene, testicular ultrasound (US), semen analysis and adrenal computed tomography (CT) scan were performed. Treatment and compliance were assessed.<h4>Results</h4>Basal 17-OHP levels were >20ng/ml in all patients. At consultation, median 17OH-P was 11.5 (2.3-81) ng/ml, FSH: 3 (0.3-4) mUI/ml, LH: 1.1 (0.1-6) mUI/ml, T: 4.3 (1.7-8) ng/ml, Δ4A: 5.7 (1.4-16) ng/ml, ACTH: 86.4 (76-334) pg/ml, PRA: 9.5 (1.3-23.6) ng/ml/h. Semen analysis was performed in 5/8 patients, showing azoospermia in two. Molecular genetic analysis was performed in 4/8 patients. TARTs were found in 5/6, being bilateral in four. Adrenal masses were found in 4/6. In the 7 patients diagnosed in childhood, their follow-up was referred to as irregular, both in their attendance at consultations and in compliance with the indicated treatment.<h4>Conclusions</h4>To our knowledge, this is the first series on adult males with classic 21-OHD which concomitantly assesses clinical presentation, molecular biology, adrenal and testicular imaging studies, semen analysis and compliance to treatment. A high prevalence of adrenal masses and TARTs was observed, possibly associated with poor treatment compliance leading to elevated ACTH and increased proliferation. Our findings on TARTs agree with reports in international publications of CAH in males, with adrenal imaging being added in our group. Although we are aware that further studies with a larger sample size and more data are needed, we consider that our findings contribute to the clinical management of classical 21-OHD in the male population.",0.9973626732826233,True
Pituitary dwarfism with large sella turcica,33796213,"Our understanding about the epidemiological aspects, pathogenesis, molecular diagnosis, and targeted therapies of neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) have drastically advanced in the past decade. Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) NENs originate from the enteroendocrine cells of the embryonic gut which share common endocrine and neural differentiation factors. Most NENs are well-differentiated, and slow growing. Specific neuroendocrine biomarkers that are used in the diagnosis of functional NENs include insulin, glucagon, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, gastrin, somatostatin, adrenocorticotropin, growth hormone releasing hormone, parathyroid hormone-related peptide, serotonin, histamine, and 5-hydroxy indole acetic acid (5-HIAA). Biomarkers such as pancreatic polypeptide, human chorionic gonadotrophin subunits, neurotensin, ghrelin, and calcitonin are used in the diagnosis of non-functional NENs. 5-HIAA levels correlate with tumour burden, prognosis and development of carcinoid heart disease and mesenteric fibrosis, however several diseases, medications and edible products can falsely elevate the 5-HIAA levels. Organ-specific transcription factors are useful in the differential diagnosis of metastasis from an unknown primary of well-differentiated NENs. Emerging novel biomarkers include circulating tumour cells, circulating tumour DNA, circulating micro-RNAs, and neuroendocrine neoplasms test (NETest) (simultaneous measurement of 51 neuroendocrine-specific marker genes in the peripheral blood). NETest has high sensitivity (85%-98%) and specificity (93%-97%) for the detection of gastrointestinal NENs, and is useful for monitoring treatment response, recurrence, and prognosis. In terms of management, surgery, radiofrequency ablation, symptom control with medications, chemotherapy and molecular targeted therapies are all considered as options. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment, but depends on factors including age of the individual, location, stage, grade, functional status, and the heredity of the tumour (sporadic <i>vs</i> inherited). Medical management is helpful to alleviate the symptoms, manage inoperable lesions, suppress postoperative tumour growth, and manage recurrences. Several molecular-targeted therapies are considered second line to somatostatin analogues.

Tonoki syndrome,33611699,"<h4>Purpose of review</h4>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has a high prevalence in western countries. Many papers have been published with the purpose of demonstrating that OSAS acts as an arrhythmia trigger and is responsible for an increase in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Spondylometaphyseal dysplasia type A4,34037865,"<h4>Purpose</h4>We investigated the prevalence of Modic changes (MCs) and associated pathologies in pediatric patients.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 368 MRI obtained for 240 male and 128 female patients under the age of 18 years with complaints of low back/leg pain were retrospectively examined. All changes in signal intensity in the vertebral endplate and subchondral bone on MRI were defined as MCs. We investigated the relationship between MCs and underlying diseases, including lumbar spondylolysis/spondylolisthesis, and conditions of the growth plate in cases with MCs. The degree of disc degeneration in patients with MCs was evaluated using the Pfirrmann grading system.<h4>Results</h4>MCs were identified in six patients (1.6%). In five of the six patients, the signal intensity changes were localized to the anterosuperior endplate of the affected vertebra; the MCs were associated with anterior apophyseal ring fracture and an open growth plate in all these cases. Disc degeneration was classified as Pfirrmann grade I in three patients and grade II and III in one patient each. One patient had type I changes associated with grade IV disc degeneration and herniation and no sign of an open growth plate.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The prevalence of MCs in pediatrics patients was much lower than the rates reported in adults. Most MCs were associated with an anterior apophyseal ring fracture. If Modic type changes are seen in immature vertebrae of pediatric patients, growth plate lesions such as apophyseal ring fractures should be considered.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>Diagnostic: individual l cross-sectional studies with consistently applied reference standard and blinding.",0.9973141551017761,True
Glycogen storage disease type 3,33923227,"The prevalence of diabetes continues to rise worldwide. In addition to rising rates of diabetic kidney disease, we are also seeing a parallel rise in nondiabetic kidney disease among patients with diabetes. These nondiabetic lesions include focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, and other glomerular diseases. The management of diabetic kidney disease is rapidly evolving to include, beyond glycemic control and renin angiotensin inhibition, the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. These and other new treatment strategies should be applicable to managing glomerular disease in diabetic patients to reduce toxicities associated with immunosuppression and, in particular, corticosteroids. The prevalence of glomerular disease in diabetic patients is underappreciated. Diagnosis and appropriately treating these diseases remain an important avenue to modify kidney outcomes in diabetic patients.",0.9972903728485107,True
Papillon Lefevre syndrome,30443435,"The mermaid syndrome (sirenomelia) is an extremely rare anomaly, an incidence of 1 in 100,000 births, in which a newborn born with legs joined together featuring a mermaid-like appearance (head and trunk like humans and tail like fish), and in most cases die shortly after birth. Gastrointestinal and urogenital anomalies and single umbilical artery are clinical outcome of this syndrome. There are two important hypotheses for pathogenesis of mermaid syndrome: vitelline artery steal hypothesis and defective blastogenesis hypothesis. The cause of the mermaid syndrome is unknown, but there are some possible factors such as age younger than 20 years and older than 40 years in mother and exposure of fetus to teratogenics. Here, we introduced 19-year-old mother's first neonate with mermaid syndrome. The mother had gestational diabetes mellitus and neonate was born with single lower limb, ambiguous genitalia, and thumb anomalies, and 4 days after birth, the neonate died due to multiple anomalies and imperforated anus.",0.9972847700119019,True

Chromosome 7p deletion,31123878,"Hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is associated with a increased incidence of low birth weight, preterm birth and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. However, available treatment options are limited. In this report, we present a case of fetal gastroschisis with a history of intrauterine exposure to methimazole. A 37-year-old woman was diagnosed with Grave's disease 3 years before her pregnancy. She had a poor response to propylthiouracil and required high-dose methimazole before her pregnancy. During the first trimester, she received methimazole 120 mg/day. After her 12th week of pregnancy, she received block-and-replace therapy (levothyroxine [LT4] 50 µg/day) because of the risk of hypothyroidism, and the dose of methimazole was downtitrated to 60 mg/day. Fetal ultrasonography showed fetal growth retardation and gastroschisis at gestational week 33. The relationship between the very high doses of methimazole in the first trimester of pregnancy and the incidence of gastroschisis in this patient was not fully understood because evidence of a relationship between the use of antithyroid drugs in the first trimester and congenital abnormalities in the fetus is lacking. Furthermore block-and-replace therapy is not recommended in pregnancy because it requires a higher dose of methimazole. We recommend preconception counseling and early screening of thyroid function. The counseling should include the best timeline for pregnancy and a discussion of the risks and benefits of hyperthyroidism treatment options.",0.9972186088562012,True
Malignant germ cell tumor,31336816,"Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) is the most prevalent category of inherited neuropathy. The most common inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant, though there also are X-linked and autosomal recessive subtypes. In addition to a variety of inheritance patterns, there are a myriad of genes associated with CMT, reflecting the heterogeneity of this disorder. Next generation sequencing (NGS) has expanded and simplified the diagnostic yield of genes/molecules underlying and/or associated with CMT, which is of paramount importance in providing a substrate for current and future targeted disease-modifying treatment options. Considerable research attention for disease-modifying therapy has been geared towards the most commonly encountered genetic mutations (<i>PMP22</i>, <i>GJB1</i>, <i>MPZ</i>, and <i>MFN2</i>).

Acalvaria,10217654,"<h4>Background</h4>The high incidence of aortic disease in subjects with congenital aortic valve malformations suggests a causative relationship between these 2 conditions. The histological observation in aortic dilatation/aneurysm/dissection is Erdheim cystic medial necrosis (CMN), a noninflammatory loss of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), fragmentation of elastic fibers, and mucoid degeneration.<h4>Methods and results</h4>To examine whether apoptosis is 1 of the mechanisms underlying CMN and aortic medial layer SMC loss, ascending aortic wall specimens from 32 patients were collected at cardiothoracic surgery and examined by histochemical staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling. From echocardiography results, 4 groups of patients were identified: bicuspid valve carriers with (bi/dil) or without (bi/0) aortic dilatation and tricuspid valve carriers with (tri/dil) or without (tri/0) aortic dilatation. Massive focal apoptosis was observed in the medial layers of bi/dil (mean apoptotic index [mAI], 8.1+/-6.0) and tri/dil (mAI, 8.1+/-8.3) compared with tri/0 (mAI, 0.9+/-1.2; P=0.0079 and P=0.037). In bi/0 (mAI, 9.1+/-5.7) compared with tri/0 (mAI, 0.9+/-1.2), rates of medial SMC apoptosis were increased (P=0.0025). Bi/dil (mean age, 40. 6+/-15.7 years) were significantly younger than tri/dil (mean age, 56.4+/-12.8 years) undergoing the same operation (P=0.0123).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Premature medial layer SMC apoptosis could be part of a genetic program underlying aortic disease in patients with aortic valve malformations.",0.9971885085105896,True

Patient cardiovascular risk factors, risk level, lipid measurements and lipid-modifying medication regimens were recorded.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 20,129 subjects who had documented diabetes and/or metabolic syndrome status, 41% had diabetes (of whom 86.8% also had the metabolic syndrome). Of those with diabetes, 48.1% were not at total cholesterol target compared with 58% of those without diabetes. Amongst those with diabetes, 41.6 and 41.3% of those with and without the metabolic syndrome, respectively, were not at their LDL cholesterol goal relative to 54.2% of those with metabolic syndrome and without diabetes, and 52% of those with neither condition. Twenty per cent of people with diabetes but without the metabolic syndrome were not at the optimal HDL cholesterol level compared with 9% of those with neither condition. Of people with diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, 49.9% were not at optimal triglyceride level relative to 13.5% of people with neither diabetes nor the metabolic syndrome. Simvastatin was the most commonly prescribed statin (>45%) and the most common statin potency was 20-40 mg/day (simvastatin equivalent). Approximately 14% of patients were taking ezetimibe alone or in combination with a statin.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite evidence supporting the benefits of lipid modification and international guideline recommendations, statin-treated patients with diabetes had a high prevalence of persistent lipid abnormalities.

All of the local registered pregnant women were continuously investigated and followed from 15 to 20 weeks of gestation to delivery, tracking the CHD cases in both the fetal and neonatal stages. A logistic regression model was applied to assess the association between CHD and possible risk factors.<h4>Results</h4>The positive rate of prenatal CHD screening was 14.36 per 1000 fetuses and the incidence of CHD was 9.38 per 1000 live births. Results from logistic regression indicated that, living in the countryside (odds ratio, (OR): 0.771; 95% confidence interval, (CI): 0.628-0.946) and having a childbearing history (OR: 0.802; 95%CI: 0.676-0.951) were negatively associated with CHD. However, twin pregnancy (OR: 1.957, 95% CI: 1.245-3.076), illness in the first trimester (OR: 1.306; 95% CI: 1.048-1.628), a family history of CHD (OR: 7.156; 95% CI: 3.293-15.552), and having a child with a birth defect (OR: 2.086; 95% CI: 1.167-3.731) were positively associated with CHD.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CHD is a serious health problem in Qingdao.

Treatment may further modify disease severity as some biological modifiers, such as anakinra, are also proposed for the management of COVID-19 patients potentially providing HS patients with an advantage. The above preliminary evidence suggests that hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) does probably not provide an increased susceptibility for COVID-19 and that any susceptibility is unlikely to be modified negatively by treatment with biologicals. On the occasion of its 10th International Conference, experts of the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation e.V. have prepared a consensus statement regarding anti-COVID-19 measurements for HS patients. Based on the available knowledge, patients with HS may be vaccinated against SARS-CoV2 and patients affected by metabolic syndrome constitute a high-risk group for COVID-19 and should be vaccinated at the earliest convenient point in time.

X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism/Lubag,34045621,"Since 2013, a high incidence of bilateral symmetrical alopecia has been observed in free-ranging Formosan macaques (Macaca cyclopis) in Mt. Longevity, Taiwan. We hypothesized that stress induces alopecia in this population. To verify our hypothesis, we evaluated the histopathological characteristics of skin biopsy and used a validated enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) analysis, which act as an indicator of stress experienced by the individual. Follicular densities were lower (2.1-3.0 mm<sup>2</sup>) in individuals with symmetrical alopecia than in those with normal hair conditions (4.7 mm<sup>2</sup>). Furthermore, anagen to catagen/telogen ratios were lower in individuals with alopecia (0-1.4) than in those with normal hair (4.0). The histopathological characteristics of alopecia were similar to those of telogen effluvium, which indicates that stress is one of the possible etiologies. On the basis of the analytical and biological validation of EIAs for FGM analysis, 11β-hydroxyetiocholanolone was considered suitable for monitoring adrenocortical activity in both sexes of Formosan macaques. The mean concentrations (standard error; sample size) of 11β-hydroxyetiocholanolone were 2.02 (0.17; n = 10) and 1.41 (0.10; n = 31) μg/g for individuals with and without alopecia, respectively. Furthermore, the results of logistic regression analysis show that 11β-hydroxyetiocholanolone (p = 0.012) concentration was positively associated with alopecia. Thus, stress was the most likely to trigger symmetrical alopecia in Formosan macaques in Mt. Longevity. Although stress can decrease the fitness of an individual, considering the population status of Formosan macaques in Taiwan is stable and alopecia was only observed in our study area, which is isolated from other populations, the impact on the total population of Formosan macaque in Taiwan is limited.

Epidemiological studies permit the timely detection of trends in CLD and of associations with other birth defects. The aim of this study is to describe the birth prevalence of CLD in the northern Netherlands.<h4>Methods</h4>In a population-based, epidemiological study we investigated the birth prevalences of CLD for 1981-2010. Data were collected by the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies in the northern Netherlands (EUROCAT-NNL). We excluded malpositions, club foot, and dislocation/dysplasia of hips or knees. Trends were analysed for the 19-year period 1992-2010 using χ² tests, as well as CLD association with anomalies affecting other organs.<h4>Results</h4>The birth prevalence of CLD was 21.1/10,000 births for 1981-2010. There was an overall decrease in non-syndromic limb defects (P = 0.023) caused by a decrease in the prevalence of non-syndromic syndactyly (P < 0.01) in 1992-2010. Of 1,048 children with CLD, 55% were males, 57% had isolated defects, 13% had multiple congenital anomalies (MCA), and 30% had a recognised syndrome. The upper:lower limb ratio was 2:1, and the left:right side ratio was 1.2:1. Cardiovascular and urinary tract anomalies were common in combination with CLD (37% and 25% of cases with MCA). Digestive-tract anomalies were significantly associated with CLD (P = 0.016).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The birth prevalence of CLD in the northern Netherlands was 21.1/10,000 births.

Neonatal herpes,33544730,"<h4>Background</h4>The prevalence of developmental alterations associated with in-utero Zika virus (ZIKV) exposure in children is not well understood. Furthermore, estimation of the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) of developmental alterations attributed to ZIKV has not been performed due to lack of population-based cohorts with data on symptomatic and asymptomatic ZIKV exposures and an appropriate control group. The aim of this study was to characterize neurodevelopmental outcomes of children at 11 to 32 months of age with intrauterine ZIKV exposure and estimate the PAF of alterations secondary to ZIKV exposure.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>We performed a cohort of biannual community-based prospective serosurveys in a slum community in Salvador, Brazil. We recruited women participating in our cohort, with a documented pregnancy from January 2015 to December 2016 and children born to those mothers. Children were classified as ZIKV exposed in utero (born from women with ZIKV seroconversion during pregnancy) or unexposed (born from women without ZIKV seroconversion or that seroconverted before/after pregnancy) by using an IgG monoclonal antibody blockade-of-binding (BoB). We interviewed mothers and performed anthropometric, audiometric, ophthalmological, neurologic, and neurodevelopmental evaluations of their children at 11 to 32 months of age. Among the 655 women participating in the cohort, 66 (10%) were pregnant during the study period. 46 (70%) of them completed follow-up, of whom ZIKV seroconversion occurred before, during, and after pregnancy in 25 (54%), 13 (28%), and 1 (2%), respectively. The rest of women, 7 (21.2%), did not present ZIKV seroconversion. At 11 to 32 months of life, the 13 ZIKV-exposed children had increased risk of mild cognitive delay (RR 5.1; 95%CI 1.1-24.4) compared with the 33 children unexposed, with a PAF of 53.5%. Exposed children also had increased risk of altered auditory behavior (RR 6.0; 95%CI 1.3-26.9), with a PAF of 59.5%.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A significant proportion of children exposed in utero to ZIKV developed mild cognitive delay and auditory behavioral abnormalities even in the absence of gross birth defects such as microcephaly and other neurodevelopmental domains. Furthermore, our findings suggest that over half of these abnormalities could be attributed to intrauterine ZIKV exposure.",0.9969623684883118,True
Aniridia renal agenesis psychomotor retardation,34113462,"Primary hyperaldosteronism (PA) is a common disease with a prevalence of 5-10% in unselected patients with hypertension. Medullary nephrocalcinosis is a radiological diagnosis and refers to diffuse calcification in the renal parenchyma. The three commonest causes of nephrocalcinosis are hyperparathyroidism, distal renal tubular acidosis, and medullary sponge kidney. PA is not a recognized cause of nephrocalcinosis. There are a few case reports linking PA with nephrocalcinosis published till date. In this case series, we report three cases where PA was possibly associated with medullary nephrocalcinosis. In all three cases, the common causes of nephrocalcinosis were excluded by careful clinical history, biochemical evaluation, and radiological findings. We conclude and emphasize that a diagnosis of PA as an etiology of medullary nephrocalcinosis should be sought after common causes have been excluded, at least in those with hypertension that is difficult to control.",0.9969581365585327,True

Serpiginous choroiditis,32984158,"<h4>Background</h4>The incidence of contralateral occult hernia (COH) varies from 4.2% to 57.5%. Total extraperitoneal (TEP) gives us opportunity to visualize contralateral groin for occult hernia and its simultaneous repair. Ultrasonography (USG) helps to diagnose occult hernia preoperatively with detection rate of 96.6% with specificity 84.4%.<h4>Objective</h4>The aims of this study were to identify the incidence of contralateral occult inguinal hernia in clinically diagnosed unilateral inguinal hernia patients using USG as diagnostic modality and to compare the clinical outcomes of unilateral TEP vs. bilateral TEP with respect to pain, duration of hospital stay, time for return to normal work, and postoperative complications.<h4>Setting and design</h4>This was a prospective observational, single-center study.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A total of 30 male patients were included in the study who was having clinically diagnosed unilateral hernia. All patients were assessed by USG for contralateral occult inguinal hernia.<h4>Results</h4>Incidence of COH was 10%, two (6.7%) had indirect defect, and 1 (3.3%) had direct defect. Two (6.7%) patients underwent bilateral TEP and 28 (93.3%) underwent unilateral TEP. No significant difference was observed in terms of mean duration of hospital stay, duration of surgery, and visual analog scale score for pain in both unilateral and bilateral TEP. The mean for resuming daily work in unilateral TEP was 4.86 ± 0.833 days and in bilateral TEP the mean was 7.50 ± 0.70 days and this showed statistically significant difference (<i>P</i> < 0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Patients with COH should be counselled for synchronous repair as there is no significant difference in clinical outcomes of unilateral and bilateral TEP. On the basis of this pilot study, it can be concluded that preoperative USG is mandatory for diagnosis and simultaneous management of preexisting contralateral hernia.",0.996925413608551,True
X-linked intellectual disability with or without nystagmus,34079467,"Diseases of the retina are major causes of visual impairment and blindness in developed countries and, due to an ageing population, their prevalence is continually rising. The lack of effective therapies and the limitations of those currently in use highlight the importance of continued research into the pathogenesis of these diseases. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays a major role in driving vascular dysfunction in retinal disease and has therefore become a key therapeutic target. Recent evidence also points to a potentially similarly important role of galectins, a family of β-galactoside-binding proteins. Indeed, they have been implicated in regulating fundamental processes, including vascular hyperpermeability, angiogenesis, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress, all of which also play a prominent role in retinopathies. Here, we review direct evidence for pathological roles of galectins in retinal disease. In addition, we extrapolate potential roles of galectins in the retina from evidence in cancer, immune and neuro-biology. We conclude that there is value in increasing understanding of galectin function in retinal biology, in particular in the context of the retinal vasculature and microglia. With greater insight, recent clinical developments of galectin-targeting drugs could potentially also be of benefit to the clinical management of many blinding diseases.",0.9969095587730408,True

Growth retardation (GR) generally accompanies CD due to gastrointestinal complications and should be treated as early as possible along with initiation of a gluten-free diet. The aim of this study was to determine the indicators of GR in patients with CD.<h4>Methods</h4>This single-centre retrospective study included paediatric outpatients with CD. All patients were diagnosed with CD via serological analysis and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy if necessary. Patient records were obtained from Adana City Training and Research Hospital. Patients that were diagnosed with GR accompanying CD were given oral nutritional supplements and followed-up every 3-6 months. Statistical relationships between demographics, and anthropometric measurements, duration of breastfeeding, gluten contact time, diet duration, presenting complaints and serological findings were evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>This study included 169 paediatric outpatients between ages 1 and 18. Longer symptom duration and shorter breastfeeding duration were significantly correlated with GR accompanying CD (P = 0.007 and P = 0.029, respectively). Vomiting was the only symptom that was correlated with the presence of GR (P = 0.010). Helicobacter pylori infection was not correlated with the presence of GR (P = 0.277).<h4>Conclusions</h4>GR should be treated as early as possible to reduce the severity of CD and a 6 months sole breastfeeding followed by solid foods accompanied by breastfeeding for 2 years is crucial for preventing GR.

Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy,33597314,"<h4>Summary</h4>Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is a rare inherited endocrine disorder with a high rate of penetrance. The incidence of MEN1 is 1/30,000 in the general population; however, it is quite rare for a patient to present for medical attention with MEN1 for the first time in pregnancy. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is one of the most common features of MEN1. The incidence of PHPT occurring in pregnancy is 1%. Despite advances in the medical, surgical and obstetric care over the years, management of this condition during pregnancy may be challenging. It can be difficult to identify pregnant women with PHPT requiring intervention and to monitor safely. Hypercalcemia can result in significant maternal and fetal adverse outcomes including: miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, neonatal hypocalcaemia, pre-eclampsia and maternal nephrolithiasis. Herein, we present a case study of a lady with a strong family history of MEN1, who was biochemically proven to have PHPT and evidence of Zollinger Ellison Syndrome (ZE) on endoscopy. This patient delayed her assisted pregnancy plans for in vitro fertilization (IVF) until completion of the MEN1 workup; nevertheless, she spontaneously achieved an unplanned pregnancy. As a result, she required intervention with parathyroidectomy in the second trimester of her pregnancy as her calcium level continued to rise. This case study highlights the workup, follow up and management of MEN1 presenting with PHPT and ZE in pregnancy.<h4>Learning points</h4>Women of childbearing age who are suspected to have a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism ideally should have genetic testing and avoid pregnancy until definitive plans are in place. Zollinger Ellison syndrome in pregnancy means off-label use of high dose of proton pump inhibitors (PPI). Use of PPI in pregnancy is considered to be safe based on retrospective studies. Omeprazole, however, is FDA class C drug because of lack of large prospective studies or large case series during pregnancy. Calcium supplements in the form of calcium carbonate must be converted to calcium chloride by gastric acid in order to be absorbed, however, patients rendered achlorhydric as a result of PPI use will have impaired absorption of calcium. Therefore, use of calcium citrate might be considered a better option in this case.",0.9968736171722412,True

We used age- and gender-adjusted linear regression to compare contrast acuity and retinal thickness between CMT groups.<h4>Results</h4>One of 5 patients with CMT2A had optic nerve atrophy (binocular high-contrast acuity equivalent 20/160, mean circumpapillary RNFL 47.5 μm). The other patients with CMT2A had normal high- and low-contrast acuity and retinal thickness, and there were no significant differences between patients with CMT2A, CMT1A, and CMTX1.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Optic atrophy occurs in some patients with CMT2A, but in others, there is no discernible optic nerve involvement. This suggests that optic neuropathy is specific to certain MFN2 mutations in CMT2A and that low-contrast acuity or OCT is of limited value as a disease-wide biomarker.",0.9968482851982117,True

We interviewed hunters in 11 coastal villages from the northern Bering Sea to the Beaufort Sea. Hunters reported extensive changes in sea ice and weather that have affected the timing of marine mammal migrations, their distribution and behaviour and the efficacy of certain hunting methods. Amidst these changes, however, hunters cited offsetting technological benefits, such as more powerful and fuel-efficient outboard engines. Other concerns included potential impacts to subsistence hunting from industrial activity such as shipping and oil and gas development.

Osteoglophonic dysplasia,33750447,"<h4>Objective</h4>To verify the prevalence of novel definitions of familial short stature on a cross-sectional cohort of children referred for short stature when their height and that of both parents were measured.<h4>Methods</h4>We consecutively enrolled 65 individuals referred for short stature when both parents were present. We defined ""target height-related short stature"" (TH-SS) when child's height is ≤ - 2 SDS and included in the range of target height; suspected ""autosomal dominant short stature"" (AD-SS) when child height and at least one parent height are ≤ - 2 SDS; ""constitutional familial short stature"" (C-FSS) when a child with TH-SS does not have any parents with height ≤ - 2 SDS.<h4>Results</h4>Of 65 children referred for SS, 48 individuals had a height ≤ - 2 SDS. Based on the parents' measured heights, 24 children had TH-SS, 16 subjects AD-SS, and 12 individuals C-FSS. If we had considered only the parents' reported height, 3 of 24 children with TH-SS, 9 of 16 with AD-SS, and 10 of 12 with C-FSS would have been lost.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We suggest novel definitions to adequately detect and approach the cases of FSS since C-FSS (25%) might not need any specific investigation, while on the contrary, AD-SS (33%) should undergo genetic evaluation.

To date, 15 genes have been characterized and several new loci have been identified, with a potential for discovery of new genes. Overall, these genes account for a large fraction of familial forms of nephrotic syndrome, but they can also be recognized in 10-20% of sporadic cases. These advances increase diagnostic and therapeutic potentials, but also add higher complexity to the scenario, requiring clear definitions of clinical, histopathological and molecular signatures. In general, genetic forms of nephrotic syndrome are resistant to common therapeutic approaches (that include steroids and calcineurin inhibitors) but, in a few cases, drug response or spontaneous remission suggest a complex pathogenesis. Finally, syndromic variants can be recognized on the basis of the associated extra-renal manifestations.

About seventy-nine million infections and more than 1.7 million death have been reported to date, along with destruction of the global economy. With the uncertainty evolved by alarming level of genome mutations, coupled with likelihood of generating only a short lived immune response by the vaccine injections, the identification of antiviral drugs for direct therapy is the need of the hour. Strategies to inhibit virus infection and replication focus on targets such as the spike protein and non-structural proteins including the highly conserved RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase, nucleotidyl-transferases, main protease and papain-like proteases. There is also an indirect option to target the host cell recognition systems such as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease, serine 2, host cell expressed CD147, and the host furin. A drug search strategy consensus in tandem with analysis of currently available information is extremely important for the rapid identification of anti-viral. An unprecedented display of cooperation among the scientific community regarding SARS-CoV-2 research has resulted in the accumulation of an enormous amount of literature that requires curation.

These developments will continue to guide strategies in long-term multidisciplinary efforts to maintain quality of life and preserve functionality in CMT patients.",0.9966874718666077,True
Retinitis Pigmentosa 7,31388435,"Approximately one-third of the world's population is infected with <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, and it is a leading cause of infertility in endemic countries. The global incidence of tuberculosis (TB) is growing at approximately 0.4% per year, and much faster in sub-Saharan Africa. TB causing fertility is rare in developed countries. We present a case of genital tuberculosis causing Asherman's syndrome and resultant infertility. The patient is a 34-year-old P0 who presented to care after a prolonged period of secondary amenorrhea and infertility. She underwent a hysterosalpingogram which demonstrated no free spill and a diagnostic hysteroscopy which had findings of mottled endometrium. Pathology returned positive for <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. The patient was treated with 9 months of antituberculous therapy. While she has not yet succeeded in becoming pregnant, the patient has started to notice cyclic spotting, indicating possible return of menses. This case highlights the importance of TB treatment and considering TB in patients who present with unexplained infertility.",0.9966617822647095,True
Proliferative verrucous leukoplakia,34213310,"The Global Atmospheric Passive Sampling (GAPS) network, initiated in 2005 across 55 global sites, supports the global monitoring plan (GMP) of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) by providing information on POP concentrations in air on a global scale. These data inform assessments of the long-range transport potential of POPs and the effectiveness evaluation of chemical regulation efforts, by observing changes in concentrations over time. Currently, measurements spanning 5-10 sampling years are available for 40 sites from the GAPS Network. This study was the first time that POP concentrations in air were reported on a global scale for an extended time period and the first to evaluate worldwide trends with an internally consistent sample set. For consistency between sampling years, site- and sample specific sampling rates were calculated with a new, public online model, which accounts for the effects of wind speed variability. Concentrations for legacy POPs in air between 2005 and 2014 show different trends for different organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). The POPs discussed in this study were chosen due to being the most frequently detected, with detection at the majority of sites. PCB, endosulfan, and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) concentrations in air are decreasing at most sites. The global trends reflect global sources and recycling of HCH, ongoing emissions from old stockpiles for PCBs, and recent use restrictions for endosulfan. These chlorinated OCPs continue to present exposure threat to humans and ecosystems worldwide. Concentrations of other OCPs, such as chlordanes, heptachlor and dieldrin, are steady and/or declining slowly at the majority of sites, reflecting a transition from primary to secondary sources (i.e., re-emission from reservoirs where these POPs have accumulated historically) which now control ambient air burdens.",0.9966212511062622,True
Chromosome 7p deletion,29184815,"Transient congenital hypothyroidism (CH) refers to a temporary deficiency of thyroid hormone identified after birth, with low thyroxine (T4) and elevated thyrotropin (TSH), which later recovers to improved thyroxine production, typically in first few months of infancy. Approximately 17% to 40% of children diagnosed with CH by newborn screening (NBS) programs were later determined to have transient hypothyroidism. Causes of transient CH are prematurity, iodine deficiency, maternal thyrotropin receptor blocking antibodies, maternal intake of anti-thyroid drugs, maternal or neonatal iodine exposure, loss of function mutations and hepatic hemangiomas. The classic clinical symptoms and signs of CH are usually absent immediately after birth in vast majority of infants due to temporary protection from maternal thyroxine. NBS has been largely successful in preventing intellectual disability by early detection of CH by performing thyroid function tests in infants with abnormal screening results. In this review we present the evidence for decision making regarding treatment vs. withholding treatment in infants with transient CH and present a rational approach to identifying transient CH based on American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendation.",0.996616542339325,True
Progressive non-fluent aphasia,34082582,"<h4>Objective</h4>To investigate the prevalence of mutations in domain V of <i>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</i> (MP) 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the clinical characteristics of pediatric MP pneumonia (MPP) in Nanjing, China.<h4>Methods</h4>Domain V of 23S rRNA was sequenced in MP strains collected from children diagnosed with MPP in Nanjing. Clinical and laboratory data were obtained.<h4>Results</h4>Among the 276 MP strains, 255 (92.39%) harbored mutations, primarily A2063G in domain V of MP 23S rRNA. When children were stratified according to the presence or absence of mutations, no significant differences were found in sex, age, the MP DNA load at enrollment, lymphocyte counts, pulmonary complications, immunomodulator levels, fever duration, the duration of fever after macrolide therapy, and hospital stay. The prevalence of refractory MPP in the two groups was similar. Children with refractory MPP exhibited higher MP DNA loads than those with non-refractory MPP.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Despite the high prevalence of the A2063G mutation in domain V of MP 23S rRNA, mutations were not associated with the clinical characteristics of MPP. The MP DNA load significantly differed between refractory and non-refractory MPP.",0.9965953230857849,True

Odontogenic myxoma,30580852,"<h4>Background</h4>The Global Anticoagulant Registry in the FIELD-Atrial Fibrillation (GARFIELD-AF) is an ongoing prospective noninterventional registry, which is providing important information on the baseline characteristics, treatment patterns, and 1-year outcomes in patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). This report describes data from Indian patients recruited in this registry.<h4>Methods and results</h4>A total of 52,014 patients with newly diagnosed AF were enrolled globally; of these, 1388 patients were recruited from 26 sites within India (2012-2016). In India, the mean age was 65.8 years at diagnosis of NVAF. Hypertension was the most prevalent risk factor for AF, present in 68.5% of patients from India and in 76.3% of patients globally (P < 0.001). Diabetes and coronary artery disease (CAD) were prevalent in 36.2% and 28.1% of patients as compared with global prevalence of 22.2% and 21.6%, respectively (P < 0.001 for both). Antiplatelet therapy was the most common antithrombotic treatment in India. With increasing stroke risk, however, patients were more likely to receive oral anticoagulant therapy [mainly vitamin K antagonist (VKA)], but average international normalized ratio (INR) was lower among Indian patients [median INR value 1.6 (interquartile range {IQR}: 1.3-2.3) versus 2.3 (IQR 1.8-2.8) (P < 0.001)]. Compared with other countries, patients from India had markedly higher rates of all-cause mortality [7.68 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval 6.32-9.35) vs 4.34 (4.16-4.53), P < 0.0001], while rates of stroke/systemic embolism and major bleeding were lower after 1 year of follow-up.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Compared to previously published registries from India, the GARFIELD-AF registry describes clinical profiles and outcomes in Indian patients with AF of a different etiology. The registry data show that compared to the rest of the world, Indian AF patients are younger in age and have more diabetes and CAD. Patients with a higher stroke risk are more likely to receive anticoagulation therapy with VKA but are underdosed compared with the global average in the GARFIELD-AF.

Feingold syndrome,33800195,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most prevalent skin cancer globally. Because most cSCC cases are manageable by local excision/radiotherapy and hardly become life-threatening, they are often excluded from cancer registries in most countries. Compared with cutaneous melanoma that originates from the melanin-producing, neural crest-derived epidermal resident, keratinocyte (KC)-derived cancers are influenced by the immune system with regards to their pathogenetic behaviour. Congenital or acquired immunosurveillance impairments compromise tumoricidal activity and raises cSCC incidence rates. Intriguingly, expanded applications of programmed death-1 (PD-1) blockade therapies have revealed cSCC to be one of the most amenable targets, particularly when compared with the mucosal counterparts arisen in the esophagus or the cervix. The clinical observation reminds us that cutaneous tissue has a peculiarly high immunogenicity that can evoke tumoricidal recall responses topically. Here we attempt to redefine cSCC biology and review current knowledge about cSCC from multiple viewpoints that involve epidemiology, clinicopathology, molecular genetics, molecular immunology, and developmental biology. This synthesis not only underscores the primal importance of the immune system, rather than just a mere accumulation of ultraviolet-induced mutations but also reinforces the following hypothesis: PD-1 blockade effectively restores the immunity specially allowed to exist within the fully cornified squamous epithelium, that is, the epidermis.",0.9964469075202942,True
West Nile virus infection,31980738,"Over 90 years ago, Otto Warburg's seminal discovery of aerobic glycolysis established metabolic reprogramming as one of the first distinguishing characteristics of cancer<sup>1</sup>.

Recent reports have, however, uncovered substantial non-carbon metabolism contributions to cancer cell viability and growth. Amino acids, nutrients vital to the survival of all cell types, experience reprogrammed metabolism in cancer. This review outlines the diverse roles of amino acids within the tumor and in the tumor microenvironment. Beyond their role in biosynthesis, they serve as energy sources and help maintain redox balance. In addition, amino acid derivatives contribute to epigenetic regulation and immune responses linked to tumorigenesis and metastasis. Furthermore, in discussing the transporters and transaminases that mediate amino acid uptake and synthesis, we identify potential metabolic liabilities as targets for therapeutic intervention.",0.9964324235916138,True

PROSTAGLANDIN-ENDOPEROXIDE SYNTHASE DEFICIENCY,33327286,<h4>Rationale</h4>Women with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) can suffer from impaired fertility rates as a result of increased androgen secretion or impaired sex steroid production. CAH patients have lower pregnancy rate compared to normal women. Only a few cases with successful pregnancy have been reported in the literature. This report described a case of CAH with successful pregnancy and live birth.<h4>Patient concerns</h4>A 23-year-old woman visited our endocrinology department for clitoral hypertrophy and primary amenorrhea.<h4>Diagnoses</h4>The patient was diagnosed as CAH.<h4>Intervention</h4>Prednisone was initially started to improve the patient's symptoms. Then she underwent clitoral resection and vaginoplasty several months later. She continuously took the prednisolone after the operation and had been undergoing regular checkups.<h4>Outcomes</h4>She was pregnant spontaneously without assisted reproductive technology and had a successful live birth. Her baby had shown normal external genitalia with normal karyotype and normal development up to 6 years of age.<h4>Lessons</h4>Some mild CAH patients with certain types can achieved successful pregnancy without any assisted reproductive technology after treatment with steroid. The pregnancy rate among CAH women who wish to conceive may be much more optimistic than previous researches.,0.9963578581809998,True

However, a much higher incidence of these tumors (>15 times) has been demonstrated in south and southeastern Brazil. Most ACCs cause hypersecretion of steroids including glucocorticoids and androgens. ACC patients have a very poor prognosis with a 5-year overall survival (OS) below 30% in most series. Pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma (PPGL) is a metabolically active tumor originating from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. The incidence of PPGL is 0.2 to 0.9 cases per 100,000 individuals per year. Pheochromocytomas are present in approximately 4-7% of patients with adrenal incidentalomas. Classically, PPGL manifests as paroxysmal attacks of the following 4 symptoms: headaches, diaphoresis, palpitations, and severe hypertensive episodes.

Glycogen storage disease type 3,33840961,"<h4>Background</h4>Hypertension is prevalent in 35%-46% of the general population; 1% of them experience accelerated hypertension. Among patients with accelerated hypertension, acute worsening of renal functions occur in 22%-55%. Morbidity and mortality rates are high. Partial renal recovery is seen in some, while others rapidly progress to end-stage renal disease.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients who presented with accelerated hypertension, renal dysfunction, and had undergone renal biopsy were evaluated and their clinical profile was analyzed. Those who became dialysis dependent were excluded from further follow-up. Study outcome were blood pressure control, renal functions, requirement of renal replacement and mortality.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 30 patients evaluated, age at presentation was 41.2 ± 15.46 years and 26 (86.7%) were males, 10 (33%) had presented with nonspecific complaints. Mean duration of hypertension and blood pressure were 21.93 months and 196 ± 20.8/129 ± 12.4 mmHg, respectively. Glomerulonephritis and hypertensive nephrosclerosis had similar characteristics except proteinuria (<i>P</i> = 0.04). Average follow-up (<i>n</i> = 25) duration was 3.69 years (range: 0.05-9.6).

Dissociative seizures,33968931,"The Ehlers-Danlos syndromes (EDS) are a group of 13 disorders, clinically defined through features of joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. Most subtypes are caused by mutations in genes affecting the structure or processing of the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein collagen. The Hypermobility Spectrum Disorders (HSDs) are clinically indistinguishable disorders, but are considered to lack a genetic basis.

Genotype-phenotype correlations are limited, and findings of aberrant collagen fibrils are inconsistent and associate poorly with the subtype and severity of the disorder. The defective ECM, however, also has consequences for cellular processes. EDS/HSD fibroblasts exhibit a dysfunctional phenotype including impairments in cell adhesion and cytoskeleton organization, though the pathological significance of this has remained unclear. Recent advances in our understanding of fibroblast mechanobiology suggest these changes may actually reflect features of a pathomechanism we herein define. This review departs from the traditional view of EDS/HSD, where pathogenesis is mediated by the structurally defective ECM.

The hallmark of this syndrome is the age specific phenotypic presentation and intraphenotypic heterogeneity. NBIAs at present include ten subtypes with genes identified in nine subtypes. They form an important differential diagnosis for the phenotype of global developmental delay in infancy/childhood to dystonia-parkinsonism or isolated parkinsonism at all ages and also for the isolated craniocervical dystonia of adult onset. There needs to be a high index of clinical suspicion for this syndrome and the evaluation includes MRI brain T2* weighted imaging which reveal symmetrical iron deposition in bilateral globus pallidi and other basal ganglia. The T2 * imaging pattern of iron deposition varies amongst the different subtypes and the combination of clinical phenotype and MRI signature makes it easier to confidently make a diagnosis of NBIA and to recommend genetic testing. The treatment to date is mostly symptomatic with targeted therapies on the horizon.",0.9960450530052185,True
Czech dysplasia metatarsal type,33499660,"Cone-rod dystrophy (CORD) is one of the inherited retinal diseases that result in central visual field deterioration and decreased visual acuity (VA). In CORD patients, impaired photoreceptor cells are observed as the disruption of ellipsoid zone (EZ) on optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. In the present study, we calculated the index of residual EZ (rEZ) to quantify the function of photoreceptor cells and investigated the correlation between rEZ index and visual functions. Twenty-six eyes of 13 patients with clinical suspicion of CORD were examined. Visual field was tested with the Humphrey Visual Field Analyzer (HFA 10-2 program). We simultaneously obtained OCT images and calculated the area of decreased EZ intensity (EZa). Using the binarized OCT images, the percentage of the rEZ in a 3 × 3 mm area surrounding the macula was analyzed. To clarify interrator reproducibility, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated. Moreover, we investigated the association between OCT parameters and VA as well as the mean deviation (MD) value measured with HFA. The mean age of the patients was 48.5 ± 16.9 years. The mean central retinal thickness was 122.7 ± 73.2 μm. The mean EZa and rEZ were 22.2 ± 23.6 μm<sup>2</sup> and 0.35 ± 0.31, respectively. The ICC of each rEZ index was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89 < ICC < 0.93).

Lactate dehydrogenase deficiency,33623632,"Since it was first documented in 1948 by Sir William Heneage Ogilvie, numerous cases of Ogilvie syndrome have been described in literature due to various medical and surgical causes. Nonetheless, only a handful of cases only have been documented due to underlying Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). A 41-year-old female was admitted with an acute abdomen secondary to partial mechanical intestinal obstruction or paralytic ileus based on signs and symptoms and Abdominal X-Ray (AXR). She was known to be HIV/AIDS WHO clinical stage II on treatment. On diagnostic imaging studies she had distended large bowels without features of mechanical intestinal obstruction and the diagnosis of Ogilvie syndrome was suspected after other differentials were excluded. Early recognition and appropriate management are essential, because if left untreated the bowel distension may progress to caecal perforation and fatal peritonitis. Medical imaging with Computer Tomography (CT) scan and colonoscopy has helped in achieving an accurate diagnosis and avoiding unnecessary laparotomies. Although an uncommon disorder, for earlier and accurate diagnosis a high index of suspicion is required by clinicians and radiologists who are treating patients with underlying HIV/AIDS. Ogilvie's syndrome is a rare condition and if missed can be fatal. In patients with HIV/AIDS, the symptoms may be directly due to HIV infection, secondary to opportunistic infections or possible neurotoxic effects of HIV treatment or lack of vitamin and minerals. It is important to exclude Ogilvie syndrome in patients from surgical causes of the acute abdomen to avoid unnecessary surgical procedures.",0.9959948062896729,True
Nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma,33260258,"<h4>Background</h4>Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene. In 1984, Scheinberg and Sternlieb estimated the prevalence of WD to be 1:30,000. However, recent epidemiological studies have reported increasing prevalence rates in different populations. The carrier frequency of ATP7B variants and the prevalence of WD in the Japanese population have not been reported using multiple databases.<h4>Methods</h4>Multiple public databases were used. First, we included mutations in the ATP7B gene that were registered in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) Professional, where 885 ATP7B variants were identified as pathogenic. Next, we investigated the allele frequencies of these 885 variants in Japanese individuals using the Human Genetic Variation Database (HGVD) and the Japanese Multi Omics Reference Panel (jMorp).<h4>Results</h4>Of the 885 variants of ATP7B, 7 and 12 missense and nonsense variants, 0 and 3 splicing variants, and 0 and 2 small deletions were found in the HGVD and in jMorp, respectively. The total allele frequencies of the ATP7B mutations were 0.011 in the HGVD and 0.014 in the jMorp. According to these data, the carrier frequencies were 0.022 (2.2%) and 0.028 (2.8%), respectively, and patient frequencies were 0.000121 (1.21/10,000 individuals) and 0.000196 (1.96/10,000 individuals), respectively.<h4>Conclusion</h4>This is the first study to report the carrier frequency of ATP7B variants and the prevalence of WD in Japan using multiple databases.

Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis,33562077,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary cancer of the liver with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Since 1963, when alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was discovered as a first HCC serum biomarker, several other protein biomarkers have been identified and introduced into clinical practice. However, insufficient specificity and sensitivity of these biomarkers dictate the necessity of novel biomarker discovery. Remarkable advancements in integrated multiomics technologies for the identification of gene expression and protein or metabolite distribution patterns can facilitate rising to this challenge. Current multiomics technologies lead to the accumulation of a huge amount of data, which requires clustering and finding correlations between various datasets and developing predictive models for data filtering, pre-processing, and reducing dimensionality. Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have an enormous potential to overcome accelerated data growth, complexity, and heterogeneity within and across data sources. Our review focuses on the recent progress in integrative proteomic profiling strategies and their usage in combination with machine learning and deep learning technologies for the discovery of novel biomarker candidates for HCC early diagnosis and prognosis. We discuss conventional and promising proteomic biomarkers of HCC such as AFP, lens culinaris agglutinin (LCA)-reactive L3 glycoform of AFP (AFP-L3), des-gamma-carboxyprothrombin (DCP), osteopontin (OPN), glypican-3 (GPC3), dickkopf-1 (DKK1), midkine (MDK), and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) and highlight their functional significance including the involvement in cell signaling such as Wnt/β-catenin, PI3K/Akt, integrin αvβ3/NF-κB/HIF-1α, JAK/STAT3 and MAPK/ERK-mediated pathways dysregulated in HCC. We show that currently available computational platforms for big data analysis and AI technologies can both enhance proteomic profiling and improve imaging techniques to enhance the translational application of proteomics data into precision medicine.",0.9959639310836792,True

Autosomal dominant tubulointerstitial kidney disease due to MUC1 mutations,33974078,"<h4>Objective</h4>We recently recorded a high prevalence of inclusion body myositis (IBM) in patients with Sjögren's syndrome (SS). Whether myositis patients with SS differ from myositis patients without SS in terms of the characteristics of the myositis is currently unknown. Anti-cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase 1 A (cN1A) has recently been proposed as a biomarker for IBM but is also frequent in SS. Whether anti-cN1A is independently associated with IBM is still an open question. We aimed to assess the significance of SS and anti-cN1A in myositis patients.<h4>Methods</h4>Cumulative data on all myositis patients (EULAR/ACR 2017 criteria) screened for SS (ACR/EULAR 2016 criteria) in a single center were analyzed. Ninety-nine patients were included, covering the whole spectrum of EULAR/ACR 2017 myositis subgroups and with a median follow-up of 6 years [range 1.0-37.5]. The 34 myositis patients with SS (myositis/SS+) were compared with the 65 myositis patients without SS (myositis/SS-).<h4>Results</h4>IBM was present in 24% of the myositis/SS+ patients vs 6% of the myositis/SS- group (p = 0.020). None of the IBM patients responded to treatment, whether they had SS or not. Anti-cN1A was more frequent in myositis/SS+ patients (38% vs 6%, p = 0.0005), independently of the higher prevalence of IBM in this group (multivariate p-value: 0.02).

Further studies are needed to improve the clinician's ability to identify infants at increased risk for HSV infection and prevent MTCT, and to develop novel antiviral agents with increased efficacy in infants with HSV infection.",0.9958017468452454,True
Gyrate atrophy of choroid and retina,33455128,"<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the prevalence and the related factors of dyslipidemia in 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) patients. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 205 patients with 21-OHD were recruited in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 2016 to January 2018. The basic information, glucocorticoid replacement therapy, and laboratory examination results of patients were obtained from medical records. The genotypes of CYP21A2 were identified by Sanger sequencing and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification. The prevalence of dyslipidemia among 21-OHD patients, basic information and related hormone levels of 21-OHD patients with different status of blood lipid were described. Logistic regression model was used to analyze the related factors of dyslipidemia in 21-OHD patients. <b>Results:</b> The age of subjects was 17.0 (8.3, 25.0) years old, including 51 males (24.9%). According to CYP21A2 genotypes, there were 16 cases in Null group, 26 cases in Group A, 105 cases in group B, 27 cases in group C, and 31 cases in group D. The incidence of dyslipidemia was 29.3% (60/205), among which 37.3% (19/51) in male and 26.6% (41/154) in female patients, respectively.

Some IBMFS may present with cytopenias in the neonatal period whereas others may present only with congenital physical abnormalities and progress to pancytopenia later in life. A thorough family history and detailed physical examination are integral to the work-up of any neonate in whom there is a high index of suspicion for an IBMFS.

We aimed to evaluate the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in this population while exploring clinical variables that may be associated with its development.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective review was performed on 29 children with IF who had achieved EA. Deficiency was defined as a mean serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D <30 ng/ml.<h4>Data results</h4>Sixty-six percent of children had at least one deficient level during the study period, with 38% being deficient based on the mean vitamin D levels. Eighty-four percent had radiologic evidence of osteopenia. Compared with the sufficient group (n=18), the deficient group (n=11) received higher daily mean vitamin D doses (2246 vs 920 IU; P=.02), had shorter remnant small-bowel length (53.8 vs 82.1 cm; P=.03), and were PN dependent for a longer duration (1.3 vs 0.58 years; P=.01). Univariate analyses revealed longer remnant gut length (odds ratio [OR] = 1.03; P=.04) and shorter duration of PN (OR = 0.26; P=.04) to be significantly associated with sufficient vitamin D status.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Vitamin D deficiency and osteopenia are highly prevalent in pediatric patients with a history of IF who have achieved EA, despite enteral supplementation with higher than standard doses. Shorter remnant small-bowel length and longer duration of PN were associated with vitamin D deficiency.

Nephrosis deafness urinary tract digital malformation,15651291,"The number of patients with spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD) has recently exceeds 20,000 in Japan. Among them, sporadic form is the most common form (67.2%). Among the hereditary forms of SCD, autosomal dominant (AD) form comprises 27.0%, while autosomal recessive (AR) form is rare (1.8%). Because of the rare occurrence of AR-SCD, the molecular genetic studies have been difficult to conduct. Recent progresses in molecular genetics, however, have enabled identification of causative genes for the majority of AR-SCD. Although Friedreich's ataxia is the most representative form of AR-SCD, patients with molecular diagnosis of Friedreich's ataxia have not been described in the Japanese population. Among the various forms of AR-SCD, early-onset ataxia with ocular motor apraxia and hypoalbuminemia (EAOH) seems to be the most common form in the Japanese population. Aprataxin, the causative gene for EAOH, has been suggested to play a role in the single strand DNA break repair. Interestingly, abnormalities in DNA break repair processes have been implicated in several forms of AR-SCD including AOA2, SCAN1 and ataxia telangiectasia.

In order to detect the circulation of West Nile (WNV) and Usutu viruses (USUV) in Kabylia, 165 sera were collected from two wild birds species, namely the long distance migrant Turdus philomelos (song thrush) (n = 92) and the resident Passer domesticus (house sparrow) (n = 73). A total of 154 sera were first analyzed by commercial competition ELISA. WNV and USUV micro-neutralization tests were performed on all c-ELISA positive sera and all samples with poor volume. Overall, 7.8 % (CI95 %: 3.5-11.9) were positive by c-ELISA. Positive results were detected in 12.5 % (CI95 %:5.6-19.4) of song thrushes and 1.5 % (CI95 %: 0.0-4.5) for sparrow. Micro-neutralization tests revealed an overall seroprevalence of 6.7 % for WNV (CI95 %: 2.9-10.3), Neutralizing antibodies were found in 8.7 % (CI95 %: 3.0-14.4) for song thrushes and in 4.1 % (CI95 %: 0.0-8.7) of sparrows.

Hereditary geniospasm,32986679,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Generally, neuropathies of peripheral nerves are a frequent condition (prevalence 2-3%) and most frequently due to alcoholism, diabetes, renal insufficiency, malignancy, toxins, or drugs. However, the vast majority of neuropathies has orphan status. This review focuses on the etiology, frequency, diagnosis, and treatment of orphan neuropathies.<h4>Methods</h4>Literature reviewResults:Rareness of diseases is not uniformly defined but in the US an orphan disease is diagnosed if the prevalence is <1:200000, in Europe if <5:10000. Most acquired and hereditary neuropathies are orphan diseases. Often the causative variant has been reported only in a single patient or family, particularly the ones that are newly detected (e.g. SEPT9, SORD). Among the complex neuropathies (hereditary multisystem disorders with concomitant neuropathies) orphan forms have been reported among mitochondrial disorders (e.g. NARP, MNGIE, SANDO), spinocerebellar ataxias (e.g. TMEM240), hereditary spastic paraplegias (e.g UBAP1), lysosomal storage disease (e.g. Schindler disease), peroxisomal disorders, porphyrias, and other types (e.g. giant axonal neuropathy, Tangier disease).

Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast,33430849,"<h4>Background</h4>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is prevalent in individuals with Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). To date, no study has investigated treatment of OSA in adult individuals with OI using positive airway pressure (PAP). This observational pilot study examined the adherence of adults with OI to treatment of OSA with PAP therapy, and the evolution of self-experienced sleepiness and depression symptoms before and after treatment.<h4>Methods</h4>We included 20 patients, with a mean age of 51 years, who represented varying severity of OI and displayed an apnea and hypopnea index ≥ 5 /sleeping hour as recorded by an overnight polysomnography. PAP therapy was proposed to all patients. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) questionnaire to evaluate daytime sleepiness, and a validated self-rating depression questionnaire to identify possible depression, were completed prior to PAP therapy and repeated after a minimum of one year. The datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are included within the article.<h4>Results</h4>From the 20 patients, 15 initiated PAP therapy, and two patients later interrupted it. The mean PAP follow-up period was 1230 days. At baseline, an abnormally high ESS score was reported by 29% of the respondents, and an abnormally high number of symptoms suggesting depression by 29%. Follow-up questionnaires were completed by 60% of the patients, of whom 83% were adherent to PAP treatment. ESS score and depression symptoms did not decrease significantly with PAP therapy.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patients with OI accepted well PAP therapy and remained compliant. Sleepiness and depression persisted unaltered despite good PAP adherence. These unexpectedly poor improvements in symptoms by PAP therapy may be due to subjective depression symptoms and the complexity of factors underlying persisting sleepiness in OI. Further research is needed to confirm this novel finding.",0.9951702952384949,True

Lesch Nyhan syndrome,31333583,"The deficiency of 21-hydroxylase due to <i>CYP21A2</i> pathogenic variants is a rather frequent disease with serious consequences, going from a real mortality risk to infertility and to milder symptoms, nevertheless important for affecting the patients' self-esteem. In the most severe cases life-threatening adrenal salt wasting crises may occur. Significant morbidity including the possibility of mistaken gender determination, precocious puberty, infertility and growth arrest with consequent short stature may also affect these patients. In the less severe cases milder symptoms like hirsutism will likely affect the image of the self with strong psychological consequences. Its diagnosis is confirmed by 17OH-progesterone dosages exceeding the cut-off value of 10/15 ng/ml but genotyping is progressively assuming an essential role in the study of these patients particularly in confirming difficult cases, determining some aspects of the prognosis and allowing a correct genetic counseling. Genotyping is a difficult process due to the occurrence of both a gene and a highly homologous pseudo gene. However, new tools are opening new possibilities to this analysis and improving the chances of a correct diagnosis and better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the disease. Beyond the 10 classic pathogenic variants usually searched for in most laboratories, a correct analysis of 21OH-deficiency cases implies completely sequencing of the entire gene and the determination of gene duplications. These are now recognized to occur frequently and can be responsible for some false positive cases. And finally, because gene conversions can include several pathogenic variants one cannot be certain of identifying that both alleles are affected without studying parental DNA samples. A complete genotype characterization should be considered essential in the preparation for pregnancy, even in the case of parents with milder forms of the disease, or even just carriers, since it has been reported that giving birth to progeny with the severe classic forms occurs with a much higher frequency than expected.",0.9950373768806458,True

Giant platelet syndrome,32858762,"Recent expansion of arboviruses such as West Nile (WNV), Usutu (USUV), and tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV) over their natural range of distribution needs strengthening their surveillance. As common viral vertebrate hosts, birds and horses deserve special attention with routine serological surveillance. Here, we estimated the seroprevalence of WNV, USUV and TBEV in 160 migrating/resident birds and 60 horses sampled in Mazandaran, Golestan, North Khorasan, Kordestan provinces and Golestan province of Iran respectively. ELISA results showed that of 220 collected samples, 32 samples (14.54%), including 22 birds and 10 horses, were positive. Microsphere immunoassay results showed that 16.7% (10/60) of horse blood samples collected in Golestan province were seropositive against WNV (7; 11.7%), Flavivirus (2; 3.3%) and seropositive for USUV or WNV (1; 1.7%). Furthermore, micro virus neutralization tests revealed that four of seven ELISA-positive bird blood samples were seropositive against WNV: two Egyptian vultures, and one long-legged buzzard collected in Golestan province as well as a golden eagle collected in North Khorasan province. No evidence of seropositivity with TBEV was observed in collected samples. We showed that WNV, responsible for neuroinvasive infection in vertebrates, is circulating among birds and horses in Iran, recommending a sustained surveillance of viral infections in animals, and anticipating future infections in humans.",0.994602620601654,True
Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system,33243194,"<h4>Background</h4>Dominant optic atrophy (DOA) is an inherited optic neuropathy that mainly affects visual acuity, central visual fields and color vision due to a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells and their axons that form the optic nerve.

The mutation spectrum of OPA1 comprises nonsense, canonical and non-canonical splice site, frameshift and missense as well as copy number variants, but intragenic inversions have not been reported so far.<h4>Case presentation</h4>We report a 33-year-old male with characteristic clinical features of DOA. Whole-genome sequencing identified a structural variant of 2.4 kb comprising an inversion of 937 bp at the OPA1 locus. Fine mapping of the breakpoints to single nucleotide level revealed that the structural variation was an inversion flanked by two deletions. As this rearrangement inverts the entire first exon of OPA1, it was classified as likely pathogenic.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We report the first DOA case harboring an inversion in the OPA1 gene.

Craniosynostosis contractures cleft,33100964,"In recent years, a growing body of research has shown sex differences in the prevalence and symptomatology of psychopathologies, such as depression, anxiety, and fear-related disorders, all of which show high incidence rates in early life. This has highlighted the importance of including female subjects in animal studies, as well as delineating sex differences in neural processing across development. Of particular interest is the corticolimbic system, comprising the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex. In rodents, these corticolimbic regions undergo dynamic changes in early life, and disruption to their normative development is believed to underlie the age and sex-dependent effects of stress on affective processing. In this review, we consolidate research on sex differences in the hippocampus, amygdala, and medial prefrontal cortex across early development. First, we briefly introduce current principles on sexual differentiation of the rodent brain. We then showcase corticolimbic regional sex differences in volume, morphology, synaptic organization, cell proliferation, microglia, and GABAergic signaling, and explain how these differences are influenced by perinatal and pubertal gonadal hormones. In compiling this research, we outline evidence of <i>what</i> and <i>when</i> sex differences emerge in the developing corticolimbic system, and illustrate how temporal dynamics of its maturational trajectory may differ in male and female rodents. This will help provide insight into potential neural mechanisms underlying sex-specific critical windows for stress susceptibility and behavioral emergence.",0.9943497776985168,True

However, there are limited data on non-cardiovascular outcomes.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine the risk of hearing loss, anxiety, developmental disorders, intellectual disabilities and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) among KD survivors vs. non-exposed children.<h4>Methods</h4>We included all Ontario children (≤18 yr) surviving hospitalization with a KD diagnosis between 1995 and 2018, using population-based health administrative databases. We excluded children with prior KD diagnoses and non-residents. KD cases were matched with 100 non-exposed children by age, sex and year. Follow-up continued until death or March 2019. We calculated the prevalence, incidence and adjusted hazard ratios (aHR [95%CI]) of outcomes between 0-1 yr, 1-5 yr, 5-10 yr and >10 yr follow-up.<h4>Results</h4>Among 4597 KD survivors, 364 (7.9%) were diagnosed with hearing loss, 1213 (26.4%) anxiety disorders, 398 (8.7%) developmental disorders, 51 (1.1%) intellectual disability and 21 (0.5%) ADHD, during median 11 year follow-up. Compared to 459,700 non-exposed children, KD survivors were not at increased risk of hearing loss after adjustment for potential confounders. KD survivors were at increased risk of anxiety disorders between 0-1 yr (aHR 1.75 [1.46-2.10]), 1-5 yr (aHR 1.13 [1.01-1.28]), 5-10 yr (aHR 1.14 [1.03-1.28]) and >10 yr (aHR 1.11 [1.02-1.22]); developmental disorders between 0-1 yr (aHR 1.49 [1.28-1.74]) and 1-5 yr (aHR 1.19 [1.02-1.40]); intellectual disabilities >10 yr (aHR 2.36 [1.36-4.10]); and ADHD >10 yr (aHR 2.01 [1.14-3.57]).<h4>Conclusions</h4>KD survivors are at increased risk of being diagnosed with anxiety disorders sooner, being diagnosed with developmental disorders between 0 and 5 yr and being diagnosed with intellectual disabilities or ADHD >10 yr after KD diagnosis.

Humeroradioulnar synostosis,32972427,"<h4>Background</h4>Mitochondrial diseases, also known as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) disorders, with a prevalence rate of 1:5000, are the most frequent inherited metabolic diseases. Leigh Syndrome French Canadian type (LSFC), is caused by mutations in the nuclear gene (2p16) leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing (LRPPRC). It is an autosomal recessive neurogenetic OXPHOS disorder, phenotypically distinct from other types of Leigh syndrome, with a carrier frequency up to 1:23 and an incidence of 1:2063 in the Saguenay-Lac-St Jean region of Quebec. Recently, LSFC has also been reported outside the French-Canadian population.<h4>Patient presentation</h4>We report a male Italian (Sicilian) child, born preterm at 28 + 6/7 weeks gestation, carrying a novel LRPPRC compound heterozygous mutation, with facial dysmorphisms, neonatal hypotonia, non-epileptic paroxysmal motor phenomena, and absent sucking-swallowing-breathing coordination requiring, at 4.5 months, a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement. At 5 months brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging showed diffuse cortical atrophy, hypoplasia of corpus callosum, cerebellar vermis hypoplasia, and unfolded hippocampi. Both auditory and visual evoked potentials were pathological. In the following months Video EEG confirmed the persistence of sporadic non epileptic motor phenomena. No episode of metabolic decompensation, acidosis or ketosis, frequently observed in LSFC has been reported. Actually, aged 14 months corrected age for prematurity, the child shows a severe global developmental delay. Metabolic investigations and array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) results were normal. Whole-exome sequencing (WES) found a compound heterozygous mutation in the LRPPRC gene, c.1921-7A > G and c.2056A > G (p.Ile686Val), splicing-site and missense variants, inherited from the mother and the father, respectively.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We first characterized the clinical and molecular features of a novel LRPPRC variant in a male Sicilian child with early onset encephalopathy and psychomotor impairment. Our patient showed a phenotype characterized by a severe neurodevelopmental delay and absence of metabolic decompensation attributable to a probable residual enzymatic activity. LRPPRC is a rare cause of metabolic encephalopathy outside of Québec. Our patient adds to and broaden the spectrum of LSFC phenotypes. WES analysis is a pivotal genetic test and should be performed in infants and children with hypotonia and developmental delay in whom metabolic investigations and aCGH are normal.",0.9940503239631653,True
Prostatic malacoplakia associated with prostatic abscess,8014972,"Kuwait has a cosmopolitan population of 1.7 million, mostly Arabs. This population is a mosaic of large and small minorities representing most Arab communities. In general, Kuwait's population is characterized by a rapid rate of growth, large family size, high rates of consanguineous marriages within the Arab communities with low frequency of intermarriage between them, and the presence of genetic isolates and semi-isolates in some extended families and Bedouin tribes. Genetic services have been available in Kuwait for over a decade. During this time it has become clear that Arabs have a high frequency of genetic disorders, and in particular autosomal recessive traits. Their pattern is unique and some disorders are relatively common. Examples are Bardet-Biedl and Meckel syndromes, phenylketonuria, and familial Mediterranean fever. A relatively large number of new syndromes and variants have been delineated in Kuwait's population, many being the result of homozygosity for autosomal recessive genes that occurred because of inbreeding. Some of these syndromes have subsequently been found in other parts of the world, negating the concept of the private syndrome.

In this article, we highlight recent efforts to improve the availability and accessibility of the disease model information in FlyBase (http://flybase.org), the model organism database for Drosophila. FlyBase has recently introduced Human Disease Model Reports, each of which presents background information on a specific disease, a tabulation of related disease subtypes, and summaries of experimental data and results using fruit flies. Integrated presentations of relevant data and reagents described in other sections of FlyBase are incorporated into these reports, which are specifically designed to be accessible to non-fly researchers in order to promote collaboration across model organism communities working in translational science. Another key component of disease model information in FlyBase is that data are collected in a consistent format --- using the evolving Disease Ontology (an open-source standardized ontology for human-disease-associated biomedical data) - to allow robust and intuitive searches. To facilitate this, FlyBase has developed a dedicated tool for querying and navigating relevant data, which include mutations that model a disease and any associated interacting modifiers.

Acoustic neuroma,32493258,"<h4>Background</h4>Congenital malformations are described in about 3% of live births and 20% of stillbirths in the industrialized countries. The prevalence of congenital anomalies in developing countries, including Morocco, is not well known at the national level. The aim of our study is to conduct a descriptive exploratory analysis of congenital malformations cases diagnosed at the ""Les Orangers"" Maternity and Reproductive Health Hospital in Rabat.<h4>Methods</h4>We collected all the cases of congenital malformations diagnosed at the ""Les Orangers"" Maternity and Reproductive Health Hospital in Rabat, from January 1st, 2011 to June 31st, 2016. Data were reported on pre-established sheets and on a registry of malformations. Total and specific prevalences were calculated for each malformation. A principal component analysis (PCA) was then conducted followed by a Varimax rotation in order to identify the different associations of malformations in our series.<h4>Results</h4>We registred 245 cases of congenital malformations out of a total of 43,923 recorded births; a prevalence of 5.58 per thousand births of which 19.2% were FDIU (fetal deaths in utero). A polymalformative syndrome was found in 26.5% of cases which makes a total number of 470 anomalies. The musculoskeletal anomalies predominate with a rate of 33%, followed by neurological abnormalities 18%, of whom 31% were hydrocephalus, 26.2% anencephaly, and 20.24% spina bifida. Malformations of the eye, ear, face and neck were described in 12% of the cases, while genetic abnormalities were observed in 8,5% of which 87.5% represented Down syndrome. The antenatal diagnosis of congenital malformations was performed in 28.6% of cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our study provides a general overview of the epidemiological situation related to different types of congenital anomalies for a specific area in Morocco. It represents a database that should be complemented by other multicenter studies and the implementation of a national registry to determine the prevalence of congenital malformations at a national level.",0.9937323927879333,True
Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1A,26987365,"<h4>Background</h4>Human lipodystrophies are uncommon disorders, with important clinical consequences, which are often undiagnosed. The Barraquer-Simons syndrome is a form of partial symmetric lipodystrophy of unknown etiology, characterized by the loss of subcutaneous adipose tissue, limited to upper part of the body. Insulin resistance and metabolic complications are less common than with other lipodystrophy subtypes. Patients usually have decreased serum complement-component 3 levels, associated with complement activation by the alternative pathway, which may indicate the presence of renal involvement.<h4>Case presentation</h4>The authors report a case of a 31-year-old woman with progressive loss of subcutaneous fat, limited to the face, neck and thorax. She presented no severe metabolic complications, neither signs of insulin resistance. Laboratory tests revealed mild dyslipidemia, and low serum levels of complement-component 3. Clinical and biochemical characteristics were consistent with the diagnosis of Barraquer-Simons syndrome.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The present case illustrates the importance of recognizing the clinical features of this lipodystrophic syndrome, which may present potentially severe consequences and psychological distress. A brief overview is made, addressing the clinical signs of the disease, its course, and how to manage it.",0.9937093257904053,True
Megalocytic interstitial nephritis,34078325,"<h4>Background</h4>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. The objective of the study was to evaluate the updated prevalence of MetS and provide a comprehensive illustration of the possible temporal changes in MetS prevalence in China from 2011 to 2015.<h4>Methods</h4>The data for this study are from the 2011 and 2015 waves of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). CHARLS is a nationally representative survey targeting populations aged 45 and above from 28 provinces in mainland China. A total of 11,847 and 13,013 participants were eligible for data analysis at the two time points.<h4>Results</h4>The estimated prevalence of MetS in 2015 was 20.41% (95% CI: 19.02-21.8%) by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (ATP III) criteria, 34.77% (95% CI: 33.12-36.42%) by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria, 39.68% (95% CI: 37.88-41.47%) by the revised ATP III criteria, and 25.55% (95% CI: 24.19-26.91%) by the Chinese Diabetes Society (CDS) criteria. The prevalence was higher among women and elderly adults and in urban and northern populations. Furthermore, the trends in the prevalence decreased significantly between 2011 and 2015 by the ATP III, revised ATP III and CDS criteria. However, trends increased significantly from 2011 to 2015 by the IDF criteria.<h4>Conclusions</h4>A higher prevalence of MetS is found in those who reported being middle aged and elderly, women, residing in northern China or living in urban areas. Additionally, temporal changes in the prevalence of MetS varied according to different criteria. Increased attention to the causes associated with populations who have higher levels of MetS is warranted.",0.9937047362327576,True
Spinocerebellar ataxia 10,33257483,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) is an inflammatory and heterogeneous astrocyte disorder of the central nervous system with the characteristic of higher incidence in women and Asian people. Most patients with NMOSD have a course of recurrence and remission that is prone to cause paralysis and blindness. Several studies have confirmed the efficacy and promising prospect of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in the treatment of NMOSD. Yet its therapeutic effect and safety are controversial. Although there has been two published literature that is relevant to the topic of this study, both of them have certain defects, and they can only provide answers about the efficacy or safety of MMF in the treatment of NMOSD from partial perspectives or conclusions. This research aims to perform a direct and comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate MMF's effectiveness and safety in treating NMOSD.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>This systematic review will cover all comparative researches, from randomised controlled trials to cohort studies, and case-control study. A relevant literature search will be conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, China Science and Technology Journal Database and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database from their inception to 31 June 2020. We will also search registers of clinical trials, potential grey literature and abstracts from conferences. There are no limits on language and publication status. The reporting quality and risk of bias will be assessed by two researchers independently. Expanded Disability Status Scales and annualised relapse rate will be evaluated as the primary outcome. The secondary outcomes will consist of the frequency and severity of adverse events, best-corrected visual acuity, relapse-free rate and time to the next attack. A meta-analysis will be performed using RevMan V.5.3 software provided by the Cochrane Collaboration and Stata V.12.0.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>Because the data used for this systematic review will be exclusively extracted from published studies, ethical approval and informed consent of patients will not be required. The systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal, presented at conferences and will be shared on social media platforms.<h4>Prospero registration number</h4>CRD42020164179.",0.9934775829315186,True
"Childhood Supratentorial Embryonal Tumor, Not Otherwise Specified",33815883,"Stroke is a leading cause of disability and mortality all over the world. Due to an aging population, the incidence of stroke is rising significantly, which has led to devastating consequences for patients. In addition to traditional risk factors such as age, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes and atrial fibrillation, sleep disorders, as independent modifiable risk factors for stroke, have been highlighted increasingly. In this review, we provide an overview of common types of current sleep disturbances in cerebrovascular diseases, including insomnia, hypersomnia, breathing-related sleep disorders, and parasomnias. Moreover, evidence-based clinical therapeutic strategies and pitfalls of specific sleep disorders after stroke are discussed. We also review the neurobiological mechanisms of these treatments as well as their effects on stroke. Since depression after stroke is so prevalent and closely related to sleep disorders, treatments of post-stroke depression are also briefly mentioned in this review article.",0.9934138655662537,True
Brachycephalofrontonasal dysplasia,30693370,"Metabolic liver diseases (MLD) are an important group of disorders presenting with neonatal cholestasis (NC). The spectrum of liver involvement is wide and the presumptive diagnosis is traditionally based on clinical and laboratory findings. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels have emerged as an appealing tool to diagnose neonatal/infantile cholestatic disorders. The aim of this study was to identify clinical phenotypes of liver injury and contribute to find a diagnostic methodology that integrates new molecular diagnostic tools. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and biochemical features of 16 patients with MLD and NC. Patients were categorized into three groups: A-NC with liver failure (N = 8): tyrosinemia type I (n = 2), classic galactosemia (n = 5), mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (n = 1); B-NC evolving with chronic liver disease (N = 5): argininemia (n = 2); mitochondrial cytopathy (n = 1); congenital disorders of glycosylation type Ia (n = 1); Zellweger syndrome (n = 1); and C-transient NC (N = 3): Niemann-Pick type C (n = 2), citrullinemia type II (n = 1).Conclusion: MLD presenting with NC can be categorized into three main clinical phenotypes of liver injury. We highlight transient NC as a clue for MLD that must be pursued. New molecular diagnostic tools can play a key role, but application criteria must be established to make them cost-effective. What is Known: • Metabolic liver diseases are an important group of disorders presenting with neonatal cholestasis. • The diagnostic approach is challenging and traditionally based on clinical and laboratory findings. Next-generation sequencing is a recent and rapidly developing tool in pediatric hepatology. What is New: • We provide a liver-targeted characterization of metabolic liver diseases presenting with neonatal cholestasis, categorizing them into three clinical phenotypes that may narrow the diagnostic possibilities. • A clinical decision-making algorithm is proposed, in which the NGS technology is integrated.",0.9933754801750183,True

The registry seeks to further understand the natural history and prevalence of FKRP-related conditions; aid the rapid identification of eligible patients for clinical studies; and provide a source of information to clinical and academic communities.<h4>Methods</h4>Registration is patient-initiated through a secure online portal. Data, reported by both patients and their clinicians, include: age of onset, presenting symptoms, family history, motor function and muscle strength, respiratory and cardiac function, medication, quality of life and pain.<h4>Results</h4>Of 663 registered participants, 305 were genetically confirmed LGMDR9 patients from 23 countries. A majority of LGMDR9 patients carried the common mutation c.826C > A on one or both alleles; 67.9% were homozygous and 28.5% were compound heterozygous for this mutation. The mean ages of symptom onset and disease diagnosis were higher in individuals homozygous for c.826C > A compared with individuals heterozygous for c.826C > A. This divergence was replicated in ages of loss of running ability, wheelchair-dependence and ventilation assistance; consistent with the milder phenotype associated with individuals homozygous for c.826C > A. In LGMDR9 patients, 75.1% were currently ambulant and 24.6%, nonambulant (unreported in 0.3%). Cardiac impairment was reported in 23.2% (30/129).<h4>Interpretation</h4>The Global FKRP Registry enables the collection of patient natural history data, which informs academics, healthcare professionals and industry.

Onychodystrophy-anonychia,34051828,"<h4>Background</h4>Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are rare, inherited lysosomal storage disorders characterized by progressive multiorgan involvement. Previous studies on incidence and prevalence of MPS mainly focused on countries other than the United States (US), showing considerable variation by country. This study aimed to identify MPS incidence and prevalence in the US at a national and state level to guide clinicians and policy makers.<h4>Methods</h4>This retrospective study examined all diagnosed cases of MPS from 1995 to 2015 in the US using the National MPS Society database records. Data included year of birth, patient geographic location, and MPS variant type. US population information was obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics. The incidence and prevalence rates were calculated for each disease. Incidence rates were calculated for each state.<h4>Results</h4>We obtained information from 789 MPS patients during a 20-year period. Incidence of MPS in the US was found to be 0.98 per 100,000 live births. Prevalence was found to be 2.67 per 1 million. MPS I, II, and III had the highest incidence rate at birth (0.26/100,000) and prevalence rates of 0.70-0.71 per million. Birth incidences of MPS IV, VI, and VII were 0.14, 0.04 and 0.027 per 100,000 live births.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This is the most comprehensive review of MPS incidence and prevalence rates in the US. Due to the large US population and state fragmentation, US incidence and prevalence were found to be lower than other countries. Nonetheless, state-level studies in the US supported these figures.

Syngnathia multiple anomalies,33165280,"<h4>Background</h4>National neonatal surveillance for herpes simplex virus (HSV) disease suggests that the incidence of HSV disease may be higher in Queensland (QLD) than in other Australian States. We sought to investigate the incidence via a retrospective 13-year evaluation of statewide laboratory data, autopsy data and linked clinical records of infants with laboratory confirmed infection.<h4>Methods</h4>All positive polymerase chain reaction HSV 1 and 2 results were obtained for infants 0-3 months of age from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2017. Clinical data were obtained from patient records and parent questionnaires were used to evaluate long-term sequelae.<h4>Results</h4>One hundred seventy-two infants with HSV positive polymerase chain reaction results: 121 (70.3%) with HSV 1. Of 104 (60.5%) infants with signs of HSV disease, 76 (73.1%) were neonates (≤28 days of age) [incidence 9.6 (95% confidence interval, 7.0-11.5) per 100,000 live births] and 28 (26.9%) were young infants (29-90 days of age) [3.6 (95% confidence interval, 2.4-5.4) per 100,000 live births]. The annual incidence of neonatal HSV disease increased significantly in Queensland over the study period (P < 0.01). Of the 76 neonates with HSV disease, 58 (76.3%) presented with the skin, eye, mouth (SEM) disease, 17 (22.4%) with HSV encephalitis and 11 (14.5%) had disseminated disease. Young infants presented with HSV skin, eye, mouth disease (21, 75.0%) or HSV encephalitis (6, 21.4%). Death occurred in 12/104 (11.5%) infants (all neonates) with 10 attributable to HSV disease.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The incidence of neonatal HSV disease in QLD is almost 3 times the national reported incidence.

The following tools were used for the pain assessment: neurological assessment, LANSS, DN4, clinical evaluation, VAS, CMTNS2 and SF-36. Statistical analysis was performed using prevalence analysis, t test, chi-square test and Spearman's rho.<h4>Results</h4>The prevalence of pain was 84.2% in the sample of this study, with moderate intensity and nociceptive characteristics according to the LANSS scale (75%) and clinical evaluation (50%), but differing from DN4, which found neuropathic pain in the majority of the patients (56.2%). Mixed pain was also observed in 43.7% of the patients, according to clinical criteria. There was a statistically significant correlation between pain intensity and SF-36, thus demonstrating that the lower the pain was, the lower the impairment was, in all domains.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Pain is a prevalent and important symptom in CMT1A, with moderate intensity and nociceptive characteristics according to two tools, but neuropathic pain is also present, and there may even be a mixed pattern of pain.

Characteristic is vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, which is often overlooked. Early diagnosis and start of therapy improve quality of life. This study aimed to characterize oculomotor dysfunction of NPC patients, and to provide ophthalmologic data including retinal imaging.<h4>Methods</h4>Eighteen patients with biochemically or genetically diagnosed NPC completed oculomotor and ophthalmologic examination. Ten of them performed saccadometry by infrared based video-oculography. Saccadic parameters were compared to 100 healthy controls, and were correlated with clinical variables. Another subgroup of eight patients received optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the optic disc and the macula, of which the segmented layers were analysed using a crude linear mixed model, and one adjusted for age, sex, and spherical equivalent.<h4>Results</h4>Saccadometry revealed slowed peak velocity compared to controls most evident vertically. Peak velocity correlated negatively with SARA-Score, but correlation with clinical assessment of saccades was not significant. Clinical features in the assessment of vertical saccades were intensive blinking and head movements to initiate gaze changes, and lateral trajectory of the eyes. Macular OCT revealed significant total retinal thinning in the fovea, specifically of the outer nuclear layer and outer retinal layer. Para- and perifoveal retinal thicknesses, as well as peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer were normal.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Foveal thinning was revealed in NPC. It remains to be shown, whether OCT will prove to be useful to monitor progression.

Nelson syndrome,32827285,"Since its first clinical description (on his son) by William James West (1793-1848) in 1841, and the definition of the classical triad of (1) infantile spasms; (2) hypsarrhythmia, and (3) developmental arrest or regression as ""West syndrome"", new and relevant advances have been recorded in this uncommon disorder. New approaches include terminology of clinical spasms (e.g., infantile (IS) vs. epileptic spasms (ES)), variety of clinical and electroencephalographic (EEG) features (e.g., typical ictal phenomena without EEG abnormalities), burden of developmental delay, spectrum of associated genetic abnormalities, pathogenesis, treatment options, and related outcome and prognosis. Aside the classical manifestations, IS or ES may present with atypical electroclinical phenotypes (e.g., subtle spasms; modified hypsarrhythmia) and may have their onset outside infancy. An increasing number of genes, proteins, and signaling pathways play crucial roles in the pathogenesis. This condition is currently regarded as a spectrum of disorders: the so-called infantile spasm syndrome (ISs), in association with other causal factors, including structural, infectious, metabolic, syndromic, and immunologic events, all acting on a genetic predisposing background.

Familial hypersecretion of adrenal androgens,32507882,"BACKGROUND:Neonatal herpes simplex virus infection (nHSV) leads to severe morbidity and mortality, but national incidence is uncertain. Florida regulations require that healthcare providers report cases, and clinical laboratories report test results when herpes simplex virus (HSV) is detected. We estimated nHSV incidence using laboratory-confirmed provider-reported cases and electronic laboratory reports (ELR) stored separately from provider-reported cases. Mortality was estimated using provider-reported cases, ELR, and vital statistics death records. METHODS:For 2011-2017, we reviewed: provider-reported cases (infants <60 days of age with HSV infection confirmed by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR)), ELR of HSV-positive culture or PCR results in the same age group, and death certificates containing International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision, codes for herpes infection: P35.2, B00.0-B00.9, and A60.0-A60.9. Provider-reported cases were matched against ELR reports. Death certificates were matched with provider and ELR reports. Chapman's capture-recapture method was used to estimate nHSV incidence and mortality. Mortality from all three sources was estimated using log-linear modelling. RESULTS:Providers reported 114 nHSV cases and ELR identified 197 nHSV cases. Forty-six cases were common to both datasets, leaving 265 unique nHSV reports. Chapman's estimate suggests 483 (95% C.I. 383-634) nHSV cases occurred (31.5 infections per 100,000 live births). nHSV deaths were reported by providers (n=9), ELR (n=18), and vital statistics (n=31), totaling 34 unique reports. Log-linear modeling estimates 35.8 fatal cases occurred (95% CI 34-40). CONCLUSIONS:Chapman's estimates using data collected over 7 years in Florida, conclude nHSV infections occurred at a rate of 1 per 3000 live births.",0.9923468828201294,True

Dandy-Walker malformation with sagittal craniosynostosis and hydrocephalus,30792378,"BACKGROUND Vascular type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) is a rare connective tissue disorder associated with a high prevalence rate of aortic dissection (AD). The coexistence of a pregnancy raises these rates and the diagnostic complexity of the situation. In this article, we present a different initial diagnostic approach to an acute aortic syndrome. CASE REPORT A young pregnant woman (29th week gestation) with vEDS was admitted to our clinic due to sudden tearing back pain radiating to the left arm. Four years ago, the same patient underwent a surgical aortic valve reconstruction and replace of the ascending and proximal arch of the aorta because of an acute Standford A AD. The clinical, laboratory as well as transthoracic echocardiographic findings did not reveal any objective signs of an acute aortic syndrome. Due to the relative contraindications against computed tomography imaging due to pregnancy, we conducted a transesophageal echocardiography which revealed acute progress of pre-existing AD. A follow-up computed tomography could verify our findings,showing a Standford B dissection, which was treated conservatively. After 2 weeks, due to a distal progression of dissection, our patient underwent a cesarean section. In absence of new clinical findings, the young patient was discharged the following week. CONCLUSIONS Patients with vEDS are at high risk of an AD and other life-threatening complications, especially during pregnancy. According to the guidelines of European Society of Cardiology (ESC), vEDS-patients should be thoroughly screened. In the case of pregnancy, physicians should consider frequent follow-up examinations and be prepared for diagnosis and treatment of the potential complications.",0.9913411736488342,True
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis,33576794,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To describe the molecular epidemiology of nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP) and Usher syndrome (US) in Italian patients.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 591 probands (315 with family history and 276 sporadics) were analyzed. For 155 of them, we performed a family segregation study, considering a total of 382 relatives. Probands were analyzed by a customized multigene panel approach. Sanger sequencing was used to validate all genetic variants and to perform family segregation studies. Copy number variants of selected genes were analyzed by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Four patients who tested negative to targeted next-generation sequencing analysis underwent clinical exome sequencing.<h4>Results</h4>The mean diagnostic yield of molecular testing among patients with a family history of retinal disorders was 55.2% while the diagnostic yield including sporadic cases was 37.4%. We found 468 potentially pathogenic variants, 147 of which were unpublished, in 308 probands and 66 relatives. Mean ages of onset of the different classes of RP were autosomal dominant RP, 19.3 ± 12.6 years; autosomal recessive RP, 23.2 ± 16.6 years; X-linked RP, 13.9 ± 9.9 years; and Usher syndrome, 18.9 ± 9.5 years. We reported potential new genotype-phenotype correlations in three probands, two revealed by TruSight One testing. All three probands showed isolated RP caused by biallelic variants in genes usually associated with syndromes such as PERCHING and Senior-Loken or with retinal dystrophy, iris coloboma, and comedogenic acne syndrome.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This is the largest molecular study of Italian patients with RP in the literature, thus reflecting the epidemiology of the disease in Italy with reasonable accuracy.",0.9912812113761902,True

Juvenile osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is an idiopathic disease of articular cartilage and subchondral bone, has an onset age of 10 to 16 years, and often affects the knee, with a prevalence of 2 to 18 per 100,000. Currently, there are few studies that have evaluated the relationship between JIA and OCD.<h4>Hypothesis</h4>OCD is more prevalent in children with JIA, and when diagnosed in such patients, OCD often presents at an advanced state.<h4>Study design</h4>Case series; Level of evidence, 4.<h4>Methods</h4>The medical records of patients with diagnoses of both JIA and OCD treated between January 2008 and March 2019 at a single children's hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Associations between timing of diagnoses, number and types of corticosteroid treatments, category of arthritis, timing of diagnoses, and lesion stability were examined with Spearman correlation coefficients.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 2021 patients with JIA were identified, 20 of whom (19 female, 1 male) had OCD of the knee and/or talus for a prevalence of 1 in 100 or 1000 in 100,000, or approximately 50 to 500 times that of the general population. These 20 patients had a total of 28 OCD lesions: 43% (9 femur, 3 talus) were radiographically stable over time, 50% (10 femur, 2 patella, 2 talus) were unstable at initial diagnosis, and 7% (2 femur) were initially stable but progressed to unstable lesions despite drilling. Twelve patients (60%) underwent surgery: 4 (20%) with stable femoral lesions for persistent symptoms despite prolonged nonoperative treatment and 8 (40%) for treatment of their unstable lesions (femoral and patellar). Within our study design, we could identify no significant associations between lesion stability and timing of diagnoses, number of joint injections, or limb deformities, nor were there associations between timing of JIA and OCD diagnoses and category of arthritis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In our population of patients with JIA, OCD lesions were found to be 50 to 500 times more prevalent when compared with published rates in the general population and often presented at an advanced state, with instability or delayed healing requiring surgery for stabilization or resolution of symptoms.",0.9912610650062561,True

We now describe a seven-year follow-up of this cohort.All patients from the primary analysis in 2006 (n = 104), were included for follow-up. Patients were screened for SCD-related organ damage and complications (microalbuminuria, renal failure, elevated tricuspid regurgitation flow velocity (TRV) (≥2.5 m/seconds), retinopathy, iron overload, cholelithiasis, avascular osteonecrosis, leg ulcers, acute chest syndrome (ACS), stroke, priapism and admissions for vaso-occlusive crises (VOC) biannually. Upon 7 years of follow-up, progression in the prevalence of avascular osteonecrosis (from 12.5% to 20.4%), renal failure (from 6.7% to 23.4%), retinopathy (from 39.7% to 53.8%) was observed in the whole group. In HbSS/HbSβ<sup>0</sup> -thal patients also progression in microalbuminuria (from 34% to 45%) and elevated TRV (from 40% to 48%) was observed while hardly any progression in the prevalence of cholelithiasis, priapism, stroke or chronic ulcers was seen. The proportion of patients with at least one episode of ACS increased in the group of HbSS/HbSβ<sup>0</sup> -thal patients from 32% to 49.1%. In conclusion, 62% of the sickle cell patients in this prospective cohort study developed a new SCD-related complication in a comprehensive care setting within 7 years of follow-up. Although the hospital admission rate for VOC remained stable, multiple forms of organ damage increased substantially. These observations underline the need for continued screening for organ damage in all adult patients with SCD.",0.9901564121246338,True
Microcephaly-cardiomyopathy,31870360,"<h4>Background</h4>To evaluate the relationship between gender, ethnicity/citizenship, clinical phenotype, total prevalence, and the various congenital malformations associated with oral clefts (OC) in Italy across the period 2001-2014.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective analysis (2001-2014) was conducted based on the National Congenital Malformation Registries network of Italy (Emilia-Romagna Registry of Birth Defects [IMER] and Registro Toscano Difetti Congeniti [RTDC]), which were analyzed to investigate time trends, geographical/ethnic clusters, topography, sex ratio, and associated congenital anomalies of OC phenotypes.<h4>Results</h4>Among 739 registered cases, 29.8% were syndromic or had multi-malformed associated anomalies, compared with 70.2% having isolated orofacial cleft. Cleft lip (CL) was observed in 22%, cleft palate (CP) in 40%, and cleft lip and palate (CLP) in 38% of live births, stillbirths, and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly cases. Other associated conditions were major anomalies of cardiovascular defects (39%), followed by defects of the limbs (28%), neuroectodermal defects (23%), and urogenital malformations (10%). Male-to-female sex ratio was 1:1.14 in CP, 1.22:1 in CL, and 1.9:1 in CLP. Foreigners were represented by 29% from Southeast Asia, 25% from Balkans, 25% from North-Central Africa, 9% from the East, 7% from Western Europe, and 5% from South America. Total prevalence of OC cases ranged from 0.9 (RTDC) to 1.1 (IMER) of 1000 births.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This retrospective study provides a population-based, clinical-epidemiological description of the orofacial cleft phenomenon. As a relatively frequent congenital malformation, its social and economic impact is worthy of further study. These abnormalities can cause significant problems that may be solved or minimized by early diagnosis and treatment.",0.9901358485221863,True

However, an accurate account of its burden in Africa, where most cases are thought to occur, is lacking. We aim to systematically evaluate the burden, aetiology and epidemiological trend of tinea capitis among children over a 30-year period in Africa.<h4>Methods and analysis</h4>A systematic review will be conducted using Embase, PubMed, African Journals Online, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library of Systematic Review. These resources will be used to identify studies published between 1990 and December 2020, which report the prevalence, aetiology and trend of tinea capitis among children younger than 18 years in Africa. Articles in English and French will be considered. Two independent reviewers will screen the articles for eligibility, and any discrepancies will be resolved by discussion and consensus between the authors. Methodological quality of all studies will be assessed and critically appraised. We will perform a metaregression to assess the impact of study characteristics on heterogeneity and also to correct the meta-analytical estimates for biases. A qualitative synthesis will be performed, and STATA V.16.0 software will be used to estimate the pooled prevalence and aetiology of tinea capitis. The Mann-Kendall trend test will be use to evaluate the trend in the prevalence of tinea capitis over the study period.<h4>Ethics and dissemination</h4>Ethical approval from an institutional review board or research ethics committee is not required for this systematic review and meta-analysis.

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A,30931926,"In contrast to acute peripheral nerve injury, the molecular response of Schwann cells in chronic neuropathies remains poorly understood. Onion bulb structures are a pathological hallmark of demyelinating neuropathies, but the nature of these formations is unknown. Here, we show that Schwann cells induce the expression of Neuregulin-1 type I (NRG1-I), a paracrine growth factor, in various chronic demyelinating diseases. Genetic disruption of Schwann cell-derived NRG1 signalling in a mouse model of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease 1A (CMT1A), suppresses hypermyelination and the formation of onion bulbs. Transgenic overexpression of NRG1-I in Schwann cells on a wildtype background is sufficient to mediate an interaction between Schwann cells via an ErbB2 receptor-MEK/ERK signaling axis, which causes onion bulb formations and results in a peripheral neuropathy reminiscent of CMT1A. We suggest that diseased Schwann cells mount a regeneration program that is beneficial in acute nerve injury, but that overstimulation of Schwann cells in chronic neuropathies is detrimental.",0.9898467659950256,True

Gas bloat syndrome,33102220,"<b>Background:</b> Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are rare, but their worldwide incidence is gradually increasing. NETs are generally heterogeneous; however, in rare cases, they have been shown to change their phenotype (i.e., nonfunctional to functional or one functional phenotype to the addition of another functional phenotype). Here, we present two cases of liver metastatic NETs with phenotype transformation at the advanced stage that led to life-threatening events. <b>Case presentation:</b> A 73-year-old woman had a small intestinal nonfunctional NET with liver metastasis. After uncontrollable liver metastasis at the advanced stage, she developed duodenal perforation with hypergastremia. The patient was treated with octreotide and proton pump inhibitors and underwent endoscopic closure for duodenal perforation, but her general condition gradually deteriorated, and she died 2 weeks after duodenal perforation. Another patient, a 50-year-old man, had a functional NET (gastrinoma) with liver metastasis and duodenal ulcer. After uncontrollable liver metastasis at the advanced stage, he developed hypoglycemia. Although octoreotide and diazoxide were administrated for hyperalimentation, his hypoglycemia was uncontrollable, and he died after 4 months owing to general deterioration. <b>Conclusion:</b> The present cases show that advanced NETs with treatment-uncontrollable liver metastasis can transform their phenotype, specifically from a nonfunctional NET into a functional NET, and from one functional NET into the addition of another functional NET. These experiences suggest that the presence of treatment-resistant liver metastasis might be a hallmark of the potential to gain novel functions.",0.9889905452728271,True

We present a detailed molecular investigation of 13 newborns affected from the severe form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia related to 21-hydroxylase deficiency.<h4>Methods</h4>All patients were diagnosed with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia in the neonatal period due to adrenal crisis and/or ambiguous genitalia presentation. None of the infants was identified through a congenital adrenal hyperplasia newborn screening program. A molecular analysis of the CYP21A2 gene and a familiar segregation analysis were performed.<h4>Results</h4>Adrenal crisis was the most severe manifestation in the male salt-wasting newborns while all female patients presented with atypical genitalia. Newborns were correctly genotyped and no genotype-phenotype divergences were found. Two novel severe genotypes, not previously reported, were identified. The novel CYP21A2 frameshift mutations (c.793delG and c.297dupG) were added to the other 45 variants recently reported in the literature, leading to a total count of 279 pathogenic variants affecting the gene.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We have successfully genotyped 13 infants diagnosed with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia after birth.

Citrulline transport defect,33317945,"<h4>Introduction/background</h4>Bladder exstrophy patients have a high prevalence of inguinal hernia that often become clinically evident following bladder closure. Understanding when the bladder exstrophy patient is under greatest risk of developing an inguinal hernia following bladder closure is important, since incarceration resulting in strangulation of intra-abdominal contents can lead to significant morbidity if not addressed in a timely fashion. Although the incidence and risk factors of inguinal hernia have been reported, the timing of occurrence is not well understood.<h4>Objective</h4>The primary objective of this study was to assess the timing of inguinal hernia following complete primary repair of bladder exstrophy (CPRE). In addition, we aimed to evaluate possible risk factors associated with inguinal hernia, including sex, age at bladder closure and iliac osteotomy status.<h4>Study design</h4>A multi-institutional retrospective review identified patients with bladder exstrophy repaired by CPRE under 6 months of age while excluding those who underwent inguinal hernia repair before or during bladder closure. Timing of inguinal hernia following bladder closure was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Cox proportional hazards model was used to investigate association of sex, age at bladder closure, and osteotomy on the risk of developing of inguinal hernia while clustering for institution.<h4>Results</h4>91 subjects were included in our analysis with median follow-up time of 6.5 years. 34 of 53 males (64.2%) and 2 of 38 females (5.3%) underwent inguinal hernia repair. The median time to inguinal hernia was 4.7 months following closure. The greatest hazard of inguinal hernia was within the first six months following closure. In multivariate analysis, male sex was strongly associated with inguinal hernia (HR = 19.00, p = 0.0038). Osteotomy and delay in closure were not significantly associated with inguinal hernia. 7 of 36 patients (19.4%) who underwent inguinal hernia repair presented with recurrence on the ipsilateral side.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our results suggest that the greatest risk of inguinal hernia is within the first six months following bladder closure. The decreased risk of inguinal hernia after one year of follow-up may reflect anatomic stability that is reached following major reconstruction of the pelvis. While male bladder exstrophy patients are significantly more susceptible to inguinal hernias following CPRE, osteotomy and delayed bladder closure do not appear to be protective factors for inguinal hernia development following initial bladder closure.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There is a heightened risk of inguinal hernia in the first six months following closure.

Common clinical features of idiopathic hypersomnia and other central disorders of hypersomnolence were queried, for the last thirty days and when symptoms were most severe. Symptoms were compared between idiopathic hypersomnia participants with and without long sleep durations and between participants with idiopathic hypersomnia and those with either form of narcolepsy. Frequency of medication use and residual symptoms on medication were evaluated.<h4>Results</h4>Five-hundred sixty-three registry respondents were included, with idiopathic hypersomnia (n = 468), narcolepsy type 2 (n = 44), and narcolepsy type 1 (n = 51). ""Brain fog,"" poor memory, and sleep drunkenness were all present in most idiopathic hypersomnia respondents, with brain fog and sleep drunkenness more commonly endorsed by those with long sleep durations.

Imerslund-Grasbeck syndrome,32683655,"<h4>Background</h4>Vitamin C deficiency is common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) due to losses through dialysis and dietary intake below requirement. We investigated prevalence of vitamin C deficiency and impact of vitamin C treatment in deficient/insufficient patients.<h4>Methods</h4>A prospective cohort study in patients aged 1-18 years with CKD stages 4 and 5D collected demographic data including underlying disease, treatment, and anthropometric assessment. Vitamin C intake was assessed using 24-h dietary recall. Hemoglobin, iron status, serum vitamin C, and serum oxalate were measured at baseline and after treatment. Vitamin C (250 mg/day) was given orally for 3 months to deficient/insufficient patients.<h4>Results</h4>Nineteen patients (mean age 12.00 ± 4.1 years) showed prevalence of 10.6% vitamin C insufficiency and 78.9% deficiency. There were no associations between vitamin C level and daily vitamin C intake (p = 0.64) or nutritional status (p = 0.87). Median serum vitamin C was 1.51 (0.30-1.90) mg/L. In 16 patients receiving treatment, median serum vitamin C increased from 1.30 (0.23-1.78) to 3.22 (1.77-5.96) mg/L (p = 0.008) without increasing serum oxalate (79.92 (56.6-106.84) vs. 80.47 (56.88-102.95) μmol/L, p = 0.82). However, 62.5% failed to achieve normal vitamin C levels.

Morquio syndrome B,31893201,"Inferior vena cava (IVC) agenesis is a rare congenital abnormality affecting the infrarenal segment, the suprarenal or the whole of the IVC. It has an estimated prevalence of up to 1% in the general population that can rise to 8.7% when abnormalities of the left renal vein are considered. Most IVC malformations are asymptomatic but may be associated with nonspecific symptoms or present as deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Up to 5% of young individuals under 30 years of age with unprovoked DVT are found to have this condition. Regarding the treatment of IVC agenesis-associated DVT, there are no standard guidelines. Treatment is directed towards preventing thrombosis or its recurrence. Low molecular weight heparin and oral anticoagulation medication, in particular vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) are the mainstay of therapy. Given the high risk of DVT recurrence in these patients, oral anticoagulation therapy is suggested to be pursued indefinitely. As far as we know, this is the first case reporting the use of a direct factor Xa inhibitor in IVC agenesis-associated DVT. Given VKA monitoring limitations, the use of a direct Xa inhibitor could be an alternative in young individuals with anatomical defects without thrombophilia, but further studies will be needed to confirm its efficacy and safety. LEARNING POINTS:Up to 5% of young individuals under 30 years of age with unprovoked deep vein thrombosis (DVT) are found to have this condition. Therefore, these types of anomalies should be actively looked for, particularly in young patients with DVT.Treatment with low molecular weight heparin or oral anticoagulation medication is the mainstay of therapy, directed towards preventing thrombosis or its recurrence.A direct factor Xa inhibitor could be a possible alternative to vitamin K antagonists in these patients, despite the lack of clinical evidence supporting its use at the moment.",0.985872745513916,True
Herpes zoster oticus,34106215,"<h4>Importance</h4>Although several single-center studies have estimated that granuloma annulare may account for approximately 0.1% to 0.4% of new patients presenting to dermatologists, large-scale population-based studies estimating the prevalence and incidence of granuloma annulare are lacking.<h4>Objectives</h4>To estimate the population-based incidence and prevalence of granuloma annulare in the United States and to identify the most commonly prescribed treatments.<h4>Design, setting, and participants</h4>This cross-sectional study used deidentified data from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart Database from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2018, to identify patients with granuloma annulare.<h4>Main outcomes and measures</h4>After validating an approach to classify patients with granuloma annulare using International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision codes, the primary outcomes were age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-specific annualized incidence and prevalence estimates for granuloma annulare. In addition, treatment use within 6 to 12 months after the first diagnosis of granuloma annulare was examined. Confidence intervals for prevalence and incidence estimates were computed assuming a binomial distribution using the Wilson score method. Age-, sex-, and race/ethnicity-specific incidence and prevalence estimates were compared using the χ2 test.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 11 608 patients with incident granuloma annulare (8680 female patients [74.8%]; mean [SD] age, 56.5 [18.8] years) and 17 862 patients with prevalent granuloma annulare (13 548 female patients [75.8%]; mean [SD] age, 56.6 [18.5] years) were identified during the study period. The overall annualized incidence of granuloma annulare was 0.04%, or 37.9 (95% CI, 36.9-38.9) per 100 000, and the overall annualized prevalence of granuloma annulare was 0.06%, or 58.3 (95% CI, 57.1-59.5) per 100 000. The incidence and prevalence of granuloma annulare were highest in the fifth decade of life. The incidence and prevalence of granuloma annulare were higher among women (incidence: female to male ratio, 2.8:1; prevalence: female to male ratio, 3.0:1). Within 6 months of their first diagnosis, 4822 patients (41.5%) filled a prescription for a topical corticosteroid, and 1087 patients (9.4%) received an intralesional injection. Within 6 months of their first diagnosis, oral tetracycline prescriptions were filled by 820 patients (7.1%), and hydroxychloroquine prescriptions were filled by 268 patients (2.3%).<h4>Conclusions and relevance</h4>Granuloma annulare is a rare disease in the United States that is more common among women and middle-aged to older individuals. The findings of this cross-sectional study provide important background regarding the basic epidemiology and overall burden of granuloma annulare in the United States. Future studies are needed to better understand the association of granuloma annulare with quality of life and the most optimal treatment approaches for this condition.",0.9857526421546936,True
Cystic medial necrosis of aorta,31414582,"<h4>Background</h4>Many public health surveillance programs utilize hospital discharge data in their estimation of disease prevalence. These databases commonly use the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) coding scheme, which transitioned from the ICD-9 clinical modification (ICD-9-CM) to ICD-10-CM on October 1, 2015. This study examined this transition's impact on the prevalence of major birth defects among infant hospitalizations.<h4>Methods</h4>Using data from the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality-sponsored National Inpatient Sample, hospitalizations during the first year of life with a discharge date between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2016 were used to estimate the monthly national hospital prevalence of 46 birth defects for the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM timeframes separately. Survey-weighted Poisson regression was used to estimate 95% confidence intervals for each hospital prevalence. Interrupted time series framework and corresponding segmented regression was used to estimate the immediate change in monthly hospital prevalence following the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition.<h4>Results</h4>Between 2012 and 2016, over 21 million inpatient hospitalizations occurred during the first year of life. Among the 46 defects studied, statistically significant decreases in the immediate hospital prevalence of five defects and significant increases in the immediate hospital prevalence of eight defects were observed after the ICD-10-CM transition.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Changes in prevalence were expected based on changes to ICD-10-CM. Observed changes for some conditions may result from variation in monthly hospital prevalence or initial unfamiliarity of coders with ICD-10-CM. These findings may help birth defects surveillance programs evaluate and interpret changes in their data related to the ICD-10-CM transition.",0.9854239821434021,True

Autosomal dominant optic atrophy plus syndrome,30126420,"BACKGROUND:Balanced reciprocal chromosomal translocations (RCTs) are the ones of the most common structural aberrations in the population, with an incidence of 1:625. RCT carriers usually do not demonstrate changes in phenotype, except when the translocation results in gene interruption. However, these people are at risk of production of unbalanced gametes during meiosis, as a result of various forms of chromosome segregation. This may cause infertility, non-implantation of the embryo, shorter embryo or foetus survival, as well as congenital defects and developmental disorders in children after birth. The increasing popularity of cytogenetic molecular techniques, such as microarray-based CGH (aCGH), contributed to the improved detection of chromosomal abnormalities in patients with intellectual disability, however, these modern techniques do not allow the identification of the balanced in potential carriers. Therefore, classical chromosome analysis with GTG technique still plays an important role in the identification of balanced rearrangements in every case of procreation failure. CASE PRESENTATION:In this article, a family with multiple occurrences of 17p13.3 duplication syndrome in the offspring and multiple miscarriages resulting from carrying of the balanced reciprocal translocation t(7;17)(p22;p13.2) by proband father is presented. The aCGH diagnostics allowed the identification of an unbalanced fragment responsible for the occurrence of clinical signs in the female patient, while karyotyping and FISH using specific probes allowed the localization of the additional material in the patient chromosomes, and identified the type of this translocation in the carriers. CONCLUSIONS:Identification of a balanced structural aberration in one of the partners allows direct diagnostics for the exclusion or confirmation of genetic imbalance in the foetus via traditional invasive prenatal diagnostics. It is also possible to use an alternative method, Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) after in vitro fertilization, which prevents initiating pregnancy if genetic imbalance is detected in the embryo.",0.9851998090744019,True
Nephrosis deafness urinary tract digital malformation,28277561,"Although AOA1 (ataxia oculomotor apraxia1) is one of the most common causes of autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxias in Japanese population, it is reported from all over the world.

N acetyltransferase deficiency,33245408,"<h4>Purpose</h4>TP53germline (g) mutations, associated with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), have rarely been reported in the context of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). The prevalence and cancer risks in this target group are unknown and counseling remains challenging. Notably an extensive high-risk surveillance program is implemented, which evokes substantial psychological discomfort. Emphasizing the lack of consensus about clinical implications, we aim to further characterize TP53g mutations in HBOC families.<h4>Methods</h4>Next-generation sequencing was conducted on 1876 breast cancer (BC) patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria for HBOC.<h4>Results</h4>(Likely) pathogenic variants in TP53 gene were present in 0.6% of the BC cohort with higher occurrence in early onset BC < 36 years. (1.1%) and bilateral vs. unilateral BC (1.1% vs. 0.3%). Two out of eleven patients with a (likely) pathogenic TP53g variant (c.542G > A; c.375G > A) did not comply with classic LFS/Chompret criteria. Albeit located in the DNA-binding domain of the p53-protein and therefore revealing no difference to LFS-related variants, they only displayed a medium transactivity reduction constituting a retainment of wildtype-like anti-proliferative functionality.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Among our cohort of HBOC families, we were able to describe a clinical subgroup, which is distinct from the classic LFS-families. Strikingly, two families did not adhere to the LFS criteria, and functional analysis revealed a reduced impact on TP53 activity, which may suit to the attenuated phenotype. This is an approach that could be useful in developing individualized screening efforts for TP53g mutation carrier in HBOC families. Due to the low incidence, national/international cooperation is necessary to further explore clinical implications. This might allow providing directions for clinical recommendations in the future.",0.984660804271698,True
Retinitis Pigmentosa 36,34122504,"<b>Background:</b> Chronic kidney disease (CKD) in childhood and adolescence occurs with a median incidence of 9 per million of the age-related population. Over 70% of CKD cases under the age of 25 years can be attributed to a hereditary kidney disease. Among these are hereditary podocytopathies, ciliopathies and (monogenic) congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). These disease entities can present with a vast variety of extrarenal manifestations. So far, skeletal anomalies (SA) have been infrequently described as extrarenal manifestation in these entities. The aim of this study was to retrospectively investigate a cohort of individuals with hereditary podocytopathies, ciliopathies or CAKUT, in which molecular genetic testing had been performed, for the extrarenal manifestation of SA. <b>Material and Methods:</b> A cohort of 65 unrelated individuals with a clinically presumed hereditary podocytopathy (focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome), ciliopathy (nephronophthisis, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, autosomal recessive/dominant polycystic kidney disease), or CAKUT was screened for SA. Data was acquired using a standardized questionnaire and medical reports. 57/65 (88%) of the index cases were analyzed using exome sequencing (ES). <b>Results:</b> 8/65 (12%) index individuals presented with a hereditary podocytopathy, ciliopathy, or CAKUT and an additional skeletal phenotype.

Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis,32359389,"E. histolytica is an intestinal parasite that causes asymptomatic infection mostly; however, it may also cause amoebic dysentery and liver abscess. Molecular identification is required in epidemiological studies due to the presence of morphologically identical nonpathogenic species. Therefore, this study was conducted to first evaluate the prevalence rate of E. histolytica among symptomatic individuals of Erbil city, and to investigate the genetic diversity of the parasite in a limited geographic area. Accordingly, a total of 2026 samples were examined microscopically, and confirmed by nested PCR for 18s rRNA gene. The results showed that the prevalence rate of E. histolytica was 1.97% (40 samples) among symptomatic patients. The SREHP gene was used as a marker to show the genetic polymorphism of E. histolytica; however, to compare the genetic diversity of symptomatic with asymptomatic isolates, 57 asymptomatic samples were obtained from our previous study. The amplified products of the SREHP gene were digested by AluI endonuclease, and DNA banding patterns were analysed. Results showed 29 different DNA patterns among the 97 symptomatic and asymptomatic samples, 62 of which shared similar DNA patterns. However, 8 different DNA patterns were observed among asymptomatic samples, whereas 15 distinct patterns were observed among symptomatic isolates.

Nail-patella syndrome,33001359,"Barth syndrome (BTHS) is a rare, X-linked recessive, infantile-onset debilitating disorder characterized by early-onset cardiomyopathy, skeletal muscle myopathy, growth delay, and neutropenia, with a worldwide incidence of 1/300,000-400,000 live births. The high mortality rate throughout infancy in BTHS patients is related primarily to progressive cardiomyopathy and a weakened immune system. BTHS is caused by defects in the TAZ gene that encodes tafazzin, a transacylase responsible for the remodeling and maturation of the mitochondrial phospholipid cardiolipin (CL), which is critical to normal mitochondrial structure and function (i.e., ATP generation). A deficiency in tafazzin results in up to a 95% reduction in levels of structurally mature CL. Because the heart is the most metabolically active organ in the body, with the highest mitochondrial content of any tissue, mitochondrial dysfunction plays a key role in the development of heart failure in patients with BTHS. Changes in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation reduce the ability of mitochondria to meet the ATP demands of the human heart as well as skeletal muscle, namely ATP synthesis does not match the rate of ATP consumption. The presence of several cardiomyopathic phenotypes have been described in BTHS, including dilated cardiomyopathy, left ventricular noncompaction, either alone or in conjunction with other cardiomyopathic phenotypes, endocardial fibroelastosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and an apical form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, among others, all of which can be directly attributed to the lack of CL synthesis, remodeling, and maturation with subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction. Several mechanisms by which these cardiomyopathic phenotypes exist have been proposed, thereby identifying potential targets for treatment. Dysfunction of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase pump and inflammation potentially triggered by circulating mitochondrial components have been identified. Currently, treatment modalities are aimed at addressing symptomatology of HF in BTHS, but do not address the underlying pathology. One novel therapeutic approach includes elamipretide, which crosses the mitochondrial outer membrane to localize to the inner membrane where it associates with cardiolipin to enhance ATP synthesis in several organs, including the heart. Encouraging clinical results of the use of elamipretide in treating patients with BTHS support the potential use of this drug for management of this rare disease.",0.9808752536773682,True

The presence of several cardiomyopathic phenotypes have been described in BTHS, including dilated cardiomyopathy, left ventricular noncompaction, either alone or in conjunction with other cardiomyopathic phenotypes, endocardial fibroelastosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and an apical form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, among others, all of which can be directly attributed to the lack of CL synthesis, remodeling, and maturation with subsequent mitochondrial dysfunction. Several mechanisms by which these cardiomyopathic phenotypes exist have been proposed, thereby identifying potential targets for treatment. Dysfunction of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase pump and inflammation potentially triggered by circulating mitochondrial components have been identified. Currently, treatment modalities are aimed at addressing symptomatology of HF in BTHS, but do not address the underlying pathology. One novel therapeutic approach includes elamipretide, which crosses the mitochondrial outer membrane to localize to the inner membrane where it associates with cardiolipin to enhance ATP synthesis in several organs, including the heart. Encouraging clinical results of the use of elamipretide in treating patients with BTHS support the potential use of this drug for management of this rare disease.",0.9808752536773682,True
Glutaric acidemia type I,33562188,"Down syndrome (DS) is the most common chromosome abnormality with a unique cancer predisposition syndrome pattern: a higher risk to develop acute leukemia and a lower incidence of solid tumors. In particular, brain tumors are rarely reported in the DS population, and biological behavior and natural history are not well described and identified. We report a case of a 10-year-old child with DS who presented with a medulloblastoma (MB). Histological examination revealed a classic MB with focal anaplasia and the molecular profile showed the presence of a <i>CTNNB1</i> variant associated with the wingless (WNT) molecular subgroup with a good prognosis in contrast to our case report that has shown an early metastatic relapse. The nearly seven-fold decreased risk of MB in children with DS suggests the presence of protective biological mechanisms. The cerebellum hypoplasia and the reduced volume of cerebellar granule neuron progenitor cells seem to be a possible favorable condition to prevent MB development via inhibition of neuroectodermal differentiation. Moreover, the NOTCH/WNT dysregulation in DS, which is probably associated with an increased risk of leukemia, suggests a pivotal role of this pathway alteration in the pathogenesis of MB; therefore, this condition should be further investigated in future studies by molecular characterizations.",0.9806733131408691,True
Nephrosclerosis,31890923,"<h4>Background & methods</h4><i>Blastocystis</i> sp. is one of the most prevalent unicellular eukaryote of the human large intestine in Chile and worldwide. It is classified in subtypes (STs), where using the polymorphic sequences of its <i>18S rRNA</i> genes currently recognizes 22. STs 1-9 and ST12 have been reported in humans. It has been hypothesized that different STs of <i>Blastocystis</i> sp. differentially affect the clinical severity of the digestive disease in Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) patients, but more studies ar4e needed to establish this statement. To contribute in the elucidation of the potential relationship between <i>Blastocystis</i> sp. subtypes and IBS severity, 37 IBS patient fecal samples were collected at hospitals in Santiago (Chile) and were screened for the presence of vacuolated forms of <i>Blastocystis</i> sp. by using conventional microscopy. Positive samples were submitted to PCR and sequencing for determining STs. The same procedure was performed in fecal samples from five non-IBS <i>Blastocystis</i> sp. carriers for preliminary comparative purpose.<h4>Results and discussion</h4>Four out of the 37 samples from the IBS patients were found positive for <i>Blastocystis</i> sp. (10.81%) by using microscopy. The presence of this microorganism in these four samples were confirmed by PCR and sequencing. Subtypes and their respective closest match alleles were searched and the ST1, ST2 and ST4 subtypes were found in these patients. ST4 subtype is scarcely detected in South America countries, being reported previously only in Colombia and Brazil. In this ST4 subtype we determined the allele 42 which is the most frequent allele observed in human <i>Blastocystis</i> isolates. In the non-IBS individuals' carriers, three subtypes were found: ST1, ST2 and ST3, even belonging to the same family group. Closest match alleles: 2, 12 and 34 here detected were also commonly reported globally. Instead of the small number of IBS patients studied here, the frequency of blastocystosis detected (10.81%) was lower than the prevalence of <i>Blastocystis</i> sp. infections described for the Chilean general population (30.4%). In Chile, clear correlation of <i>Blastocystis</i> sp. subtypes and IBS severity is still lacking with this study but it may lead and contribute to a better understanding of its pathogenicity and worldwide epidemiology.",0.9805288910865784,True

Only limited studies have explored the relationship between frailty and vitamin C deficiency. This study investigated the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency and its association with frailty severity in patients ≥75 years admitted under a geriatric unit. Patients (<i>n</i> = 160) with a mean age of 84.4 ± 6.4 years were recruited and underwent frailty assessment by use of the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS). Patients with an EFS score <10 were classified as non-frail/vulnerable/mildly frail and those with ≥10 as moderate-severely frail. Patients with vitamin C levels between 11-28 μmol/L were classified as vitamin C depleted while those with levels <11 μmol/L were classified as vitamin C deficient. A multivariate logistic regression model determined the relationship between vitamin C deficiency and frailty severity after adjustment for various co-variates. Fifty-seven (35.6%) patients were vitamin C depleted, while 42 (26.3%) had vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C levels were significantly lower among patients who were moderate-severely frail when compared to those who were non-frail/vulnerable/mildly frail (<i>p</i> < 0.05). After adjusted analysis, vitamin C deficiency was 4.3-fold more likely to be associated with moderate-severe frailty (aOR 4.30, 95% CI 1.33-13.86, <i>p =</i> 0.015).

IRF6-Related disorders,34066544,"Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction, rapid in onset, and can lead to fatal consequences if not promptly treated. The incidence of anaphylaxis has risen at an alarming rate in past decades and continues to rise. Therefore, there is a general interest in understanding the molecular mechanism that leads to an exacerbated response. The main effector cells are mast cells, commonly triggered by stimuli that involve the IgE-dependent or IgE-independent pathway. These signaling pathways converge in the release of proinflammatory mediators, such as histamine, tryptases, prostaglandins, etc., in minutes. The action and cell targets of these proinflammatory mediators are linked to the pathophysiologic consequences observed in this severe allergic reaction. While many molecules are involved in cellular regulation, the expression and regulation of transcription factors involved in the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators and secretory granule homeostasis are of special interest, due to their ability to control gene expression and change phenotype, and they may be key in the severity of the entire reaction. In this review, we will describe our current understanding of the pathophysiology of human anaphylaxis, focusing on the transcription factors' contributions to this systemic hypersensitivity reaction. Host mutation in transcription factor expression, or deregulation of their activity in an anaphylaxis context, will be updated. So far, the risk of anaphylaxis is unpredictable thus, increasing our knowledge of the molecular mechanism that leads and regulates mast cell activity will enable us to improve our understanding of how anaphylaxis can be prevented or treated.",0.9792988300323486,True
Giant platelet syndrome,33254358,"<h4>Objectives</h4>West Nile virus (WNV) is a re-emerging mosquito-borne viral infection. This study investigated the pooled prevalence pattern and risk factors of WNV infection among humans and animals in Nigeria.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic review was conducted of eligible studies published in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Web of Science from January 1, 1950 to August 30, 2020. Peer-reviewed cross-sectional studies describing WNV infections in humans and animals were systematically reviewed. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochrane Q statistic.<h4>Results</h4>Eighteen out of 432 available search output were eligible and included for this study. Of which 13 and 5 were WNV studies on humans and animals, respectively. Although 61.5% of the human studies had a low risk of bias, they all had high heterogeneity. The South West geopolitical zone of Nigeria had the highest pooled prevalence of anti-WNV immunoglobulin M (IgM; 7.8% in humans). The pooled seroprevalence of anti-WNV IgM and immunoglobulin G (IgG) was 7.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9 to 8.3) and 76.5% (95% CI, 74.0 to 78.8), respectively. The WNV RNA prevalence was 1.9% (95% CI, 1.4 to 2.9), while 14.3% (95% CI, 12.9 to 15.8) had WNV-neutralizing antibodies. In animals, the pooled seroprevalence of anti-WNV IgM and IgG was 90.3% (95% CI, 84.3 to 94.6) and 3.5% (95% CI, 1.9 to 5.8), respectively, while 20.0% (95% CI, 12.9 to 21.4) had WNV-neutralizing antibodies.

Subpulmonary stenosis,34197773,"As the HIV epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa matures, evidence about the age distribution of new HIV infections and how this distribution has changed over the epidemic is needed to guide HIV prevention. We aimed to assess trends in age-specific HIV incidence in six population-based cohort studies in eastern and southern Africa, reporting changes in mean age at infection, age distribution of new infections, and birth cohort cumulative incidence. We used a Bayesian model to reconstruct age-specific HIV incidence from repeated observations of individuals' HIV serostatus and survival collected among population HIV cohorts in rural Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe, in a collaborative analysis of the ALPHA network. We modelled HIV incidence rates by age, time, and sex using smoothing splines functions. We estimated incidence trends separately by sex and study. We used estimated incidence and prevalence results for 2000-17, standardised to study population distribution, to estimate mean age at infection and proportion of new infections by age. We also estimated cumulative incidence (lifetime risk of infection) by birth cohort. Age-specific incidence declined at all ages, although the timing and pattern of decline varied by study. The mean age at infection was higher in men (cohort mean 27·8-34·6 years) than in women (24·8-29·6 years). Between 2000 and 2017, the mean age at infection per cohort increased slightly: 0·5 to 2·8 years among men and -0·2 to 2·5 years among women. Across studies, between 38% and 63% (cohort medians) of the infections in women were among those aged 15-24 years and between 30% and 63% of infections in men were in those aged 20-29 years. Lifetime risk of HIV declined for successive birth cohorts. HIV incidence declined in all age groups and shifted slightly to older ages. Disproportionate new HIV infections occur among women aged 15-24 years and men aged 20-29 years, supporting focused prevention in these groups. However, 40-60% of infections were outside these ages, emphasising the importance of providing appropriate HIV prevention to adults of all ages.

Five months later the neurological deficit progressed within a few days to lower paraplegia and upper paraparesis, retention of urine and faeces, impaired somatic and deep sensation below the level of Th1 dermatome. The results from laboratory investigations confirmed anaemic syndrome, increased urea and creatinine, hypoproteinemia and severe proteinuria. The results from CSF investigations demonstrated hyperproteinorachia with extremely high Ig fractions. Serum and CSF oligoclonal bands and positive serum Aquaporin IgG 32 times higher than the upper referent limit were found. The association with SLE was confirmed by the increased levels of total ANA and anti-ds-DNA ANA. MRT visualized the spinal cord as non-homogenously hypointense on T1 and extremely hyperintense on FLAIR sequences through its whole length up to the bulbar-pontine region.

The study population included infants diagnosed with oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum during the 1990-2009 period from 34 registries active in 16 European countries. Of the 355 infants diagnosed with oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum, there were 95.8% (340/355) live born, 0.8% (3/355) fetal deaths, 3.4% (12/355) terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly and 1.5% (5/340) neonatal deaths. In 18.9%, there was prenatal detection of anomaly/anomalies associated with oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum, 69.7% were diagnosed at birth, 3.9% in the first week of life and 6.1% within 1 year of life. Microtia (88.8%), hemifacial microsomia (49.0%) and ear tags (44.4%) were the most frequent anomalies, followed by atresia/stenosis of external auditory canal (25.1%), diverse vertebral (24.3%) and eye (24.3%) anomalies.

Pierson syndrome,29093661,"Craniosynostosis is a heterogeneous condition caused by the premature fusion of cranial sutures, occurring mostly as an isolated anomaly. Pathogenesis of non-syndromic forms of craniosynostosis is largely unknown. In about 15-30% of cases craniosynostosis occurs in association with other physical anomalies and it is referred to as syndromic craniosynostosis. Syndromic forms of craniosynostosis arise from mutations in genes belonging to the Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) family and the interconnected molecular pathways in most cases. However it can occur in association with other gene variants and with a variety of chromosome abnormalities as well, usually in association with intellectual disability (ID) and additional physical anomalies. Evaluating the molecular properties of the genes undergoing intragenic mutations or copy number variations (CNVs) along with prevalence of craniosynostosis in different conditions and animal models if available, we made an attempt to define two distinct groups of unusual syndromic craniosynostosis, which can reflect direct effects of emerging new candidate genes with roles in suture homeostasis or a non-specific phenotypic manifestation of pleiotropic genes, respectively. RASopathies and 9p23p22.3 deletions are reviewed as examples of conditions in the first group. In particular, we found that craniosynostosis is a relatively common component manifestation of cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. Chromatinopathies and neurocristopathies are presented as examples of conditions in the second group. We observed that craniosynostosis is uncommon on average in these conditions. It was randomly associated with Kabuki, Koolen-de Vries/KANSL1 haploinsufficiency and Mowat-Wilson syndromes and in KAT6B-related disorders. As an exception, trigonocephaly in Bohring-Opitz syndrome reflects specific molecular properties of the chromatin modifier ASXL1 gene.

Heterozygous inactivating mutations involving the maternal GNAS exons 1-13 that encodes the alpha subunit of the stimulatory G protein (Gsα) cause inactivating parathyroid hormone (PTH)/PTHrP signalling disorder type 2 (iPPSD2 or PHP type 1A), which is characterized by Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and resistance to multiple hormones that act through the Gsα signalling pathway (including PTH, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone). To date, little information is available on craniofacial features in patients with PHP. The small number of patients studied in previous reports as well as the lack of molecular characterization of the patients may have precluded the detection of specific orofacial manifestations in the different PHP subtypes.<h4>Materials/methods</h4>We conducted a systematic analysis of dental and craniofacial features in 19 patients with iPPSD2 and maternal GNAS inactivating mutations to assess the frequency and specificity of the anomalies.<h4>Results</h4>Facial examinations showed reduced vertical, sagittal, and transverse development of the mid-facial structures. Intraoral and radiographic examinations revealed that 89 per cent of the patients had at least one dental anomaly, including tooth submergence leading to severe infraocclusion in 83 per cent of cases. Craniofacial analysis of lateral cephalometric radiographs also showed a significant alteration in the development of the cranial base and maxillary and mandibular structures in these patients.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patients with iPPSD2 and maternal GNAS mutations had specific craniofacial alterations and dental abnormalities. These specific defects should be assessed in order to provide appropriate dental and orthodontic care to these patients.

Characteristics of each cardiac rupture were collected and analyzed.<h4>Results</h4>Among 4190 patients, 75 (1.8%) patients had cardiac rupture, including 33 at the ventricular septum and 42 at the left ventricle free wall (LVFW). Patients with cardiac rupture were more likely to be female, with more advanced age, lower rate of primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI), and higher in-hospital mortality. Compared with survivors, the death cases were older, had a higher white blood cell count, higher rate of delayed admission (>12 h from symptom onset to door), earlier occurrence of cardiac rupture, higher percentage of LVFW rupture and lower rate of surgical repair. Logistic regression analysis showed that surgical repair served as the most valuable factor affecting survival. Moreover, elevated white blood cell count and advanced age might be related to an increased in-hospital death due to cardiac rupture.<h4>Conclusions</h4>In this contemporary cohort, female sex, advanced age and low rate of PPCI post-STEMI are associated with an increased risk of cardiac rupture. Advanced age and elevated white blood cell count might be related to an increased in-hospital mortality after cardiac rupture, whereas surgical repair served as the most valuable factor affecting survival.",0.9742935299873352,True

Its incidence is less than 1 per 5000 individuals and the disease is the cause of about 2% of end stage renal disease in Europe and the United States. Alport syndrome is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. It is related to mutations in the genes encoding one of three chains, α3, α4 α5 of type IV collagen, the main component of basement membranes, expressed in the glomerular basement membrane. COL4A5 mutations are associated with X-linked Alport syndrome, which represents 80 to 85% of cases and is more severe in boys than in girls. Mutations in COL4A3 or COL4A4 are associated with autosomal Alport syndrome. The expression of collagen chains in skin and kidney basement membranes allows for the diagnosis and characterization of the mode of transmission in most patients. It is necessary to diagnose this syndrome because its family involvement, its severity, and the importance of genetic counseling. Angiotensin blockers are increasingly prescribed in proteinuric patients. Prospective studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of these treatments on proteinuria and progression of kidney failure, and to specify indications.

Marshall syndrome,31263216,"<h4>Purpose</h4>We observed four individuals in two unrelated but consanguineous families from Portugal and Brazil affected by early-onset retinal degeneration, sensorineural hearing loss, microcephaly, intellectual disability, and skeletal dysplasia with scoliosis and short stature. The phenotype precisely matched that of an individual of Azorean descent published in 1986 by Liberfarb and coworkers.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients underwent specialized clinical examinations (including ophthalmological, audiological, orthopedic, radiological, and developmental assessment). Exome and targeted sequencing was performed on selected individuals. Minigene constructs were assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Sanger sequencing.<h4>Results</h4>Affected individuals shared a 3.36-Mb region of autozygosity on chromosome 22q12.2, including a 10-bp deletion (NM_014338.3:c.904-12_904-3delCTATCACCAC), immediately upstream of the last exon of the PISD (phosphatidylserine decarboxylase) gene. Sequencing of PISD from paraffin-embedded tissue from the 1986 case revealed the identical homozygous variant. In HEK293T cells, this variant led to aberrant splicing of PISD transcripts.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We have identified the genetic etiology of the Liberfarb syndrome, affecting brain, eye, ear, bone, and connective tissue.

Rare intellectual disability without developmental anomaly,30800398,"On 3 August 1900, bubonic plague (<i>Yersinia pestis</i>) broke out in Glasgow for the first time during the Third Pandemic. The local sanitary authorities rigorously tracked the spread of the disease and they found that nearly all of the 35 cases could be linked by contact with a previous case. Despite trapping hundreds of rats in the area, there was no evidence of a rat epizootic and the investigators speculated that the outbreak could be due to human-to-human transmission of bubonic plague. Here we use a likelihood-based method to reconstruct transmission trees for the outbreak. From the description of the outbreak and the reconstructed trees, we infer several epidemiological parameters. We found that the estimated mean serial interval was 7.4-9.2 days and the mean effective reproduction number dropped below 1 after implementation of control measures. We also found a high rate of secondary transmissions within households and observations of transmissions from individuals who were not terminally septicaemic.

However, clinical features of CR patients now and the effect of reperfusion therapy to CR remain unclear. We investigated the clinical features of CR in STEMI patients and the effect of reperfusion therapy to CR in mice.<h4>Methods</h4>Two studies were conducted. In clinical study, data of 1456 STEMI patients admitted to the First Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University during 2015.12. ~ 2018.12. were analyzed. In experimental study, 83 male C57BL/6 mice were operated to induce MI. Of them, 39 mice were permanent MI (group-1), and remaining mice received reperfusion after 1 h ischemia (21 mice, group-2) or 4 h ischemia (23 mice, group-3). All operated mice were monitored up to day-10. Animals were inspected three times daily for the incidence of death and autopsy was done for all mice found died to determine the cause of death.<h4>Results</h4>CR was diagnosed in 40 patients: free-wall rupture in 17, ventricular septal rupture in 20, and combined locations in 3 cases. CR presented in 19 patients at admission and diagnosed in another 21 patients during 1 ~ 14 days post-STEMI, giving an in-hospital incidence of 1.4%. The mortality of CR patients was high during hospitalization accounting for 39% of total in-hospital death. By multivariate logistic regression analysis, older age, peak CK-MB and peak hs-CRP were independent predictors of CR post-STEMI. In mice with non-reperfused MI, 17 animals (43.6%) died of CR that occurred during 3-6 days post-MI. In MI mice received early or delayed reperfusion, all mice survived to the end of experiment except one mouse died of acute heart failure.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CR remains as a major cause of in-hospital death in STEMI patients.

Christian Johnson Angenieta syndrome,18067674,"Deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) activity is an inborn error of purine metabolism associated with uric acid overproduction and a continuum spectrum of neurological manifestations depending on the degree of the enzymatic deficiency. The prevalence is estimated at 1/380,000 live births in Canada, and 1/235,000 live births in Spain. Uric acid overproduction is present inall HPRT-deficient patients and is associated with lithiasis and gout. Neurological manifestations include severe action dystonia, choreoathetosis, ballismus, cognitive and attention deficit, and self-injurious behaviour. The most severe forms are known as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (patients are normal at birth and diagnosis can be accomplished when psychomotor delay becomes apparent). Partial HPRT-deficient patients present these symptoms with a different intensity, and in the least severe forms symptoms may be unapparent. Megaloblastic anaemia is also associated with the disease. Inheritance of HPRT deficiency is X-linked recessive, thus males are generally affected and heterozygous female are carriers (usually asymptomatic). Human HPRT is encoded by a single structural gene on the long arm of the X chromosome at Xq26. To date, more than 300 disease-associated mutations in the HPRT1 gene have been identified. The diagnosis is based on clinical and biochemical findings (hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria associated with psychomotor delay), and enzymatic (HPRT activity determination in haemolysate, intact erythrocytes or fibroblasts) and molecular tests. Molecular diagnosis allows faster and more accurate carrier and prenatal diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis can be performed with amniotic cells obtained by amniocentesis at about 15-18 weeks' gestation, or chorionic villus cells obtained at about 10-12 weeks' gestation. Uric acid overproduction can be managed by allopurinol treatment. Doses must be carefully adjusted to avoid xanthine lithiasis. The lack of precise understanding of the neurological dysfunction has precluded development of useful therapies. Spasticity, when present, and dystonia can be managed with benzodiazepines and gamma-aminobutyric acid inhibitors such as baclofen.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 2,31275245,"<b>Background:</b> Twenty-one-hydroxylase-deficient non-classic adrenal hyperplasia (NC-CAH) is a very common autosomal recessive syndrome with prevalence between 1:1,000 and 1:2,000 individuals and the frequency varies according to ethnicity. On the other hand, polycystic ovary syndrome has a familial basis and it is inherited under a complex hereditary trait. This syndrome affects 6 to 10% of women in reproductive age and it is the most common endocrine disorder in young women. Our aim was to investigate, through a systematic review, the distinct characteristics and common findings of these syndromes. <b>Methods:</b> The search period covered January 1970 to November 2018, using the scientific databases PubMed. Inclusion criteria were adult women patients with PCOS or NC-CAH. Search terms were ""polycystic ovary syndrome,"" ""PCOS,"" ""non-classical adrenal hyperplasia,"" ""NC-CAH,"" ""21-hydroxylase deficiency."" From an initial 16,255 titles, the evaluations led to the final inclusion of 97 papers. <b>Results:</b> The clinical features of NC-CAH are hirsutism and ovulatory and menstrual dysfunction therefore; differentiation between these two syndromes is difficult based on clinical grounds only. Additionally, NC-CAH and PCOS are both associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidaemia. Reproductive abnormalities are also common between these hyperandrogenemic disorders since in patients with NC-CAH polycystic ovarian morphology and subfertility are present as they are in women with PCOS. The diagnosis of PCOS, is confirmed once other disorders that mimic PCOS have been excluded e.g., conditions that are related to oligoovulation or anovulation and/or hyperandrogenism, such as hyperprolactinaemia, thyroid disorders, non-classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and androgen-producing neoplasms. <b>Conclusions:</b> The screening tool to distinguish non-classic adrenal hyperplasia from PCOS is the measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels. The basal levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone may overlap, but ACTH stimulation testing can distinguish the two entities. In this review these two common endocrine disorders are discussed in an effort to unveil their commonalities and to illuminate their shadowed distinctive characteristics.",0.9662396907806396,True
Familial chylomicronemia syndrome,33937943,"<h4>Purpose of review</h4>Cardiovascular toxicity is a leading cause of mortality among cancer survivors and has become increasingly prevalent due to improved cancer survival rates. In this review, we synthesize evidence illustrating how common cancer therapeutic agents, such as anthracyclines, human epidermal growth factors receptors (HER2) monoclonal antibodies, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have been evaluated in cardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to understand the underlying mechanisms of cardiovascular toxicity. We place this in the context of precision cardio-oncology, an emerging concept for personalizing the prevention and management of cardiovascular toxicities from cancer therapies, accounting for each individual patient's unique factors. We outline steps that will need to be addressed by multidisciplinary teams of cardiologists and oncologists in partnership with regulators to implement future applications of hiPSCs in precision cardio-oncology.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Current prevention of cardiovascular toxicity involves routine screenings and management of modifiable risk factors for cancer patients, as well as the initiation of cardioprotective medications. Despite recent advancements in precision cardio-oncology, knowledge gaps remain and limit our ability to appropriately predict with precision which patients will develop cardiovascular toxicity. Investigations using patient-specific CMs facilitate pharmacological discovery, mechanistic toxicity studies, and the identification of cardioprotective pathways. Studies with hiPSCs demonstrate that patients with comorbidities have more frequent adverse responses, compared to their counterparts without cardiac disease. Further studies utilizing hiPSC modeling should be considered, to evaluate the impact and mitigation of known cardiovascular risk factors, including blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, diabetes, and physical activity in their role in cardiovascular toxicity after cancer therapy. Future real-world applications will depend on understanding the current use of hiPSC modeling in order for oncologists and cardiologists together to inform their potential to improve our clinical collaborative practice in cardio-oncology. When applying such in vitro characterization, it is hypothesized that a safety score can be assigned to each individual to determine who has a greater probability of developing cardiovascular toxicity. Using hiPSCs to create personalized models and ultimately evaluate the cardiovascular toxicity of individuals' treatments may one day lead to more patient-specific treatment plans in precision cardio-oncology while reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality.",0.9661656022071838,True
Aniridia renal agenesis psychomotor retardation,33247957,"<h4>Aims</h4>Medullary carcinoma is an uncommon colorectal tumour which appears poorly differentiated histologically. Consequently, it may be confused with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (NOS). The principal aim of this study was to review a large series of poorly differentiated colorectal cancers resected at a large National Health Service (NHS) Teaching Hospital to determine how often medullary carcinomas were misclassified . Secondary aims were to investigate how often neuroendocrine differentiation or metastatic tumours were considered in the differential diagnosis, and compare clinico-pathological features between medullary and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma NOS.<h4>Methods and results</h4>Histology slides from 302 colorectal cancer resections originally reported as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma were reviewed and cases fulfilling World Health Organisation (WHO) criteria for medullary carcinoma identified. The original pathology report was examined for any mention of medullary phenotype, consideration of neuroendocrine differentiation or consideration of metastasis from another site. Clinico-pathological features were compared to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma NOS. Only one-third of medullary carcinomas were correctly identified between 1997 and 2018. The other two-thirds were reported as poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma NOS. The possibility of an extracolonic origin or neuroendocrine carcinoma was considered in 21 and 27% of reports. Most medullary carcinomas exhibited mismatch repair deficiency, were located in ascending colon and caecum and had a lower rate of vascular channel invasion and lymph node metastasis compared to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Medullary carcinoma of the colon is often mistaken for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma NOS and occasionally for neuroendocrine or metastatic carcinoma. Greater familiarity with morphological criteria and use of mismatch repair protein staining should improve diagnosis.",0.9641753435134888,True
Rare intellectual disability without developmental anomaly,33166354,"<h4>Background</h4>Plague is a re-emerging flea-borne infectious disease of global importance and in recent years, Zambia has periodically experienced increased incidence of outbreaks of this disease. However, there are currently no studies in the country that provide a quantitative assessment of the ability of the disease to spread during these outbreaks. This limits our understanding of the epidemiology of the disease especially for planning and implementing quantifiable and cost-effective control measures. To fill this gap, the basic reproduction number, R0, for bubonic plague was estimated in this study, using data from the 2015 Nyimba district outbreak, in the Eastern province of Zambia. R0 is the average number of secondary infections arising from a single infectious individual during their infectious period in an entirely susceptible population.<h4>Methodology/principal findings</h4>Secondary epidemic data for the most recent 2015 Nyimba district bubonic plague outbreak in Zambia was analyzed. R0 was estimated as a function of the average epidemic doubling time based on the initial exponential growth rate of the outbreak and the average infectious period for bubonic plague. R0 was estimated to range between 1.5599 [95% CI: 1.382-1.7378] and 1.9332 [95% CI: 1.6366-2.2297], with average of 1.7465 [95% CI: 1.5093-1.9838]. Further, an SIR deterministic mathematical model was derived for this infection and this estimated R0 to be between 1.4 to 1.5, which was within the range estimated above.<h4>Conclusions/significance</h4>This estimated R0 for bubonic plague is an indication that each bubonic plague case can typically give rise to almost two new cases during these outbreaks. This R0 estimate can now be used to quantitatively analyze and plan measurable interventions against future plague outbreaks in Zambia.",0.962252140045166,True
Glucagonoma,21344626,"Carbimazole (CMZ) and its active metabolite methimazole (MMI) are antithyroid medications, which can result in MMI/CMZ embryopathy in susceptible individuals. The incidence of birth defects related to MMI/CMZ embryopathy remains unclear as several epidemiologic studies failed to prove a correlation, despite positive case-control studies and numerous case reports. Malformations reported in exposed individuals and commonly recognized as MMI/CMZ embryopathy include cutis aplasia of the scalp, choanal atresia, esophageal atresia (EA), tracheo-esophageal fistula (TEF), persistent vitelline duct, athelia/hypothelia, and subtle facial dysmorphisms including sparse or arched eyebrows. Here, we report on individuals with early pregnancy exposure to MMI, with microtia and various other anomalies associated with MMI embryopathy, suggesting that microtia is also seen with increased frequency after prenatal MMI exposure. Additional unusual malformations among our patients include a previously unreported type of TEF with three separate esophageal pouches and a fistula connecting the middle pouch to the trachea in one child, and absence of the gall bladder in another. An enlarged anterior fontanel was seen in three patients, and clinodactyly of the fifth finger was noted in three. The similarities between our three patients with microtia after MMI exposure and the two previously reported with microtia after CMZ exposure support the concept of microtia being related to the MMI/CMZ exposure. Recognition of microtia as a manifestation of MMI/CMZ embryopathy will likely increase the number of diagnosed cases and thus affect ascertainment. We propose diagnostic criteria for MMI/CMZ embryopathy, including the presence of at least one major characteristic finding.",0.9611364006996155,True

Megalencephaly-Polymicrogyria-Polydactyly-Hydrocephalus syndrome,34171682,"<h4>Background</h4>Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) is an increasing diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in Latin America (LATAM). Despite the heterogeneity of this population, ethnic and socioeconomic commonalities exist, and epidemiologic studies from the region have had a limited geographic and population outreach. Identification of some aspects from the entire region are lacking.<h4>Objectives</h4>To determine ethnic, clinical characteristics, and utilization of diagnostic tools and types of therapy for patients with NMOSD in the entire Latin American region.<h4>Methods</h4>The Latin American Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (LACTRIMS) created an exploratory investigational survey addressed by Invitation to NMOSD Latin American experts identified through diverse sources. Data input closed after 30 days from the initial invitation. The questionnaire allowed use of absolute numbers or percentages. Multiple option responses covering 25 themes included definition of type of practice; number of NMOSD cases; ethnicity; utilization of the 2015 International Panel criteria for the diagnosis of Neuromyelitis optica (IPDN); clinical phenotypes; methodology utilized for determination of anti-Aquaporin-4 (anti- AQP4) antibodies serological testing, and if this was performed locally or processed abroad; treatment of relapses, and long-term management were surveyed.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 62 investigators from 21 countries reporting information from 2154 patients (utilizing the IPDN criteria in 93.9% of cases), which were categorized in two geographical regions: North-Central, including the Caribbean (NCC), and South America (SA). Ethnic identification disclosed Mestizos 61.4% as the main group. The most common presenting symptoms were concomitant presence of optic neuritis and transverse myelitis in 31.8% (p=0.95); only optic neuritis in 31.4% (more common in SA), p<0.001); involvement of the area postrema occurred in 21.5% and brain stem in 8.3%, both were more frequent in the South American cases (p<0.001). Anti-AQP4 antibodies were positive in 63.9% and anti-Myelin Oligodendrocyte Glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies in 4.8% of total cases. The specific laboratorial method employed was not known by 23.8% of the investigators. Acute relapses were identified in 81.6% of cases, and were treated in 93.9% of them with intravenous steroids (IVS); 62.1% with plasma exchange (PE), and 40.9% with intravenous immunoglobulin-G (IVIG). Therapy was escalated in some cases due to suboptimal initial response. Respondents favored Rituximab as long-term therapy (86.3%), whereas azathioprine was also utilized on 81.8% of the cases, either agent used indistinctly by the investigators according to treatment accessibility or clinical judgement. There were no differences among the geographic regions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This is the first study including all countries of LATAM and the largest cohort reported from a multinational specific world area. Ethnic distributions and phenotypic features of the disease in the region, challenges in access to diagnostic tools and therapy were identified. The Latin American neurological community should play a determinant role encouraging and advising local institutions and health officials in the availability of more sensitive and modern diagnostic methodology, in facilitating the the access to licensed medications for NMOSD, and addressing concerns on education, diagnosis and management of the disease in the community.",0.959006667137146,True

Osteochondroma,27703456,"The life span of patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiency is increasing due to recent improvements in therapeutic strategies. While the incidence of primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) is 1:10,000 births, that of secondary immunodeficiencies are more common and are associated with posttransplantation immune dysfunction, with immunosuppressive medication for human immunodeficiency virus or with human T-cell lymphotropic virus infection. After infection, malignancy is the most prevalent cause of death in both children and adults with (PIDs). PIDs more often associated with cancer include common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, ataxia-telangiectasia, and severe combined immunodeficiency. This suggests that a protective immune response against both infectious non-self-(pathogens) and malignant self-challenges (cancer) exists. The increased incidence of cancer has been attributed to defective elimination of altered or ""transformed"" cells and/or defective immunity towards cancer cells. The concept of aberrant immune surveillance occurring in PIDs is supported by evidence in mice and from patients undergoing immunosuppression after transplantation. Here, we discuss the importance of PID defects in the development of malignancies and the current limitations associated with molecular pathogenesis of these diseases and emphasize the need for further knowledge of how specific mutations can modulate the immune system to alter immunosurveillance and thereby play a key role in the etiology of malignancies in PID patients.",0.9520710706710815,True

Yet more genotype-phenotype correlation studies from populations not ascertained on clinical symptoms or family history of disease are required to improve understanding of gene penetrance. We performed targeted sequencing of 25 genes used routinely in clinical genetic testing for inherited cardiovascular disorders in a population of 13,131 asymptomatic older individuals (mean age 75 years) enrolled in the ASPREE trial. Participants had no prior history of cardiovascular disease events, dementia or physical disability at enrolment. Variants were classified following ACMG/AMP standards. Sudden and rapid cardiac deaths were clinically adjudicated as ASPREE trial endpoints, and assessed during mean 4.7 years of follow-up. In total, 119 participants had pathogenic/deleterious variants in one of the 25 genes analysed (carrier rate of 1 in 110 or 0.9%).

Respiratory disorders and feeding difficulties represent the main burden.<h4>Objective</h4>The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology of PRS using a cohort of cases from EUROCAT, the European network of population-based registries of congenital anomalies.<h4>Methods</h4>We analysed cases of PRS born in the period 1998-2017 collected by 29 population-based congenital anomaly registries in 17 different countries. We calculated prevalence estimates, prenatal detection rate, survival up to 1 week, and proportions of associated anomalies. The effect of maternal age was tested using a Poisson regression model.<h4>Results</h4>Out of 11 669 155 surveyed births, a total of 1294 cases of PRS were identified. The estimate of the overall prevalence was 12.0 per 100 000 births (95% CI 9.9, 14.5). There was a total of 882 (68.2%) isolated cases, and the prevalence was 7.8 per 100 000 births (95% CI 6.7, 9.2). A total of 250 cases (19.3%) were associated with other structural congenital anomalies, 77 cases (6.0%) were associated with chromosomal anomalies and 77 (6.0%) with genetic syndromes. The prenatal detection rate in isolated cases was 12.0% (95% CI 9.8, 14.5) and increased to 16.0% (95% CI 12.7, 19.7) in the sub-period 2008-2017.

Survival of chromosomal cases (94.2%) and multiple anomaly cases (95.3%) were lower than survival of isolated cases (99.4%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>This epidemiological study using a large series of cases of PRS provides insights into the epidemiological profile of PRS in Europe. We observed an association with higher maternal age, but further investigations are needed to test potential risk factors for PRS.",0.9397082328796387,True
Brachycephalofrontonasal dysplasia,31268178,"Urea cycle disorders (UCDs) are rare inherited metabolic conditions that impair the effectiveness of the urea cycle responsible for removing excess ammonia from the body. The estimated incidence of UCDs is 1:35 000 births, or approximately 113 new patients with UCD per year. This review summarizes neuropsychological outcomes among patients with the eight UCDs in reports published since 1980. Rates of intellectual disabilities published before (and including) 2000 and after 2000 were pooled and compared for each UCD. Since diagnoses for UCDs tended to occur earlier and better treatments became more readily available after the turn of the century, this assessment will characterize the extent that current management strategies have improved neuropsychological outcomes. The pooled sample included data on cognitive abilities of 1649 individuals reported in 58 citations. A total of 556 patients (34%) functioned in the range of intellectual disabilities. The decline in the proportion of intellectual disabilities in six disorders, ranged from 7% to 41%. Results from various studies differed and the cohorts varied with respect to age at symptom onset, age at diagnosis and treatment initiation, current age, severity of the metabolic deficiency, management strategies, and ethnic origins. The proportion of cases with intellectual disabilities ranged from 9% to 65% after 2000 in the seven UCDs associated with cognitive deficits.

Cleft hand absent tibia,34134783,"<h4>Background</h4>Craniosynostosis, defined as premature fusion of one or more cranial sutures, affects approximately 1 in every 2000-2500 live births. Sagittal craniosynostosis (CS), the most prevalent form of isolated craniosynostosis, is caused by interplay between genetic and perinatal environmental insults. However, the underlying details remain largely unknown.<h4>Methods</h4>The proband (a female monochorionic twin diagnosed with CS), her healthy co-twin sister and parents were enrolled. Obstetric history was extracted from medical records. Genetic screening was performed by whole exome sequencing (WES) and confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Functional annotation, conservation and structural analysis were predicted in public database. Phenotype data of Axin2 knockout mice was downloaded from The International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC, http://www.mousephenotype.org ).<h4>Results</h4>Obstetric medical records showed that, except for the shared perinatal risk factors by the twins, the proband suffered additional persistent breech presentation and intrauterine growth restriction. We identified a heterozygous mutation of Axin2 (c.1181G > A, p.R394H, rs200899695) in monochorionic twins and their father, but not in the mother. This mutation is not reported in Asian population and results in replacement of Arg at residue 394 by His (p.R394H). Arg 394 is located at the GSK3β binding domain of Axin2 protein, which is highly conserved across species. The mutation was predicted to be potentially deleterious by in silico analysis. Incomplete penetrance of Axin2 haploinsufficiency was found in female mice.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Axin2 (c.1181G > A, p.R394H, rs200899695) mutation confers susceptibility and perinatal risk factors trigger the occurrence of sagittal craniosynostosis. Our findings provide a new evidence for the gene-environment interplay in understanding pathogenesis of craniosynostosis in Chinese population.",0.931496262550354,True
Cold-induced sweating syndrome,33610611,"Snakebites in Europe are mostly due to bites from Viperidae species of the genus Vipera. This represents a neglected public health hazard with poorly defined incidence, morbidity and mortality. In Europe, fourteen species of ""true vipers"" (subfamily Viperinae) are present, eleven of which belong to the genus Vipera. Amongst these, the main medically relevant species due to their greater diffusion across Europe and the highest number of registered snakebites are six, namely: Vipera ammodytes, V. aspis, V. berus, V. latastei, V. seoanei and V. ursinii. Generally speaking, viper venom composition is characterised by many different toxin families, like phospholipases A2, snake venom serine proteases, snake venom metalloproteases, cysteine-rich secretory proteins, C-type lectins, disintegrins, haemorrhagic factors and coagulation inhibitors. A suspected snakebite is often associated with severe pain, erythema, oedema and, subsequently, the onset of an ecchymotic area around one or two visible fang marks. In the field, the affected limb should be immobilised and mildly compressed with a bandage, which can then be removed once the patient is being treated in hospital. The clinician should advise the patient to remain calm to reduce blood circulation and, therefore, decrease the spread of the toxins. In the case of pain, an analgesic therapy can be administered, the affected area can be treated with hydrogen peroxide or clean water. However, anti-inflammatory drugs and disinfection with alcohol or alcoholic substances should be avoided. For each patient, clinical chemistry and ECG are always a pre-requisite as well as the evaluation of the tetanus immunisation status and for which immunisation may be provided if needed. The treatment of any clinical complication, due to the envenomation, does not differ from treatments of emergency nature. Antivenom is recommended when signs of systemic envenomation exist or in case of advanced local or systemic progressive symptoms. Recommendations for future work concludes.

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to determine plasma vitamin C levels. As per Johnston's criteria, vitamin C levels of ≥28 μmol/L were classified as normal and <28 μmol/L as low. Clinical outcomes determined included length of hospital stay (LOS), nosocomial complications, intensive care unit admission and in-hospital mortality.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 200 patients participated in this study, and vitamin C levels were available for 149 patients, of whom 35 (23.5%) had normal vitamin C levels, and 114 (76.5%) had hypovitaminosis C. Patients with hypovitaminosis C were older and had higher C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Median LOS was 2 days longer in patients with hypovitaminosis C (6 days (interquartile range (IQR) 4, 8) vs 4 days (IQR 3, 6), P = 0.02), and they had fourfold higher odds of staying in hospital for >5 days than those with normal vitamin C levels. Other clinical outcomes were similar between the two groups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Hypovitaminosis C is common in hospitalised patients and is associated with prolonged LOS. Further research is needed to ascertain the benefits of vitamin C supplementation in vitamin C-depleted patients.",0.9291673898696899,True
Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum,31073436,"Aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA), the most common aortic arch abnormality, occurs in approximately 0.5 to 1.8% of the general population, with prevalence of up to 25% in those with esophageal atresia. Although ARSA is often asymptomatic, a fistulous tract into esophagus may develop with prolonged nasogastric tube placement or endotracheal intubation and lead to potentially fatal hematemesis. We present a first case of ARSA-esophageal fistula in a 20-year-old woman with VATER association in the absence of an esophageal anomaly and review 28 cases of ARSA-esophageal fistula reported in the literature to date. Requiring nasogastric and endotracheal tube placement for approximately 4 months, the patient had a prolonged hospital course and died after sudden hematemesis. An autopsy demonstrated an ARSA-esophageal fistula and no other source of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. In patients with esophageal atresia requiring prolonged placement of an endotracheal or nasogastric tube, a screening imaging study and corrective surgery may be indicated. Although the mortality rate is still high, timely recognition and repair of ARSA-esophageal fistula appear to be improving. Given the potentially prolonged latency for its development with occasional presence of heralding symptoms, increased awareness may facilitate surgical intervention to prevent a catastrophic exsanguination.",0.9284322261810303,True
Microphthalmia microtia fetal akinesia,31469254,"<h4>Objective</h4>The diagnosis of childhood-onset cerebellar ataxia (CA) is often challenging due to variations in symptoms and etiologies. Despite the known regional differences in the prevalence of etiologies underlying CA, the frequency and characteristics of CA in Japan remain unclear. We conducted a questionnaire-based survey to identify the clinical characteristics of childhood-onset CA in the Japanese population.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Questionnaires were sent to 1,103 board-certified pediatric neurologists in Japan from 2016 to 2017. The primary survey requested the number of patients with CA under care, and the follow-up secondary questionnaire requested additional clinical characteristics of the patients.<h4>Results</h4>The primary survey obtained 578 responses (response rate, 52.4%) on 385 patients with CA, including 171 diagnosed and 214 undiagnosed cases (diagnostic rate, 44.4%). The most frequent etiology was dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), followed by mitochondrial disorders and encephalitis. The secondary survey obtained the clinical characteristics of 252 cases (119 diagnosed and 133 undiagnosed cases). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that a younger age at onset, hearing issues, and short stature were associated with a higher risk of remaining undiagnosed with CA in Japan.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The diagnostic rate of childhood-onset CA in the current study was comparable to those reported in other countries. The high prevalence of autosomal dominant ataxia, especially DRPLA, was a signature of CA in Japan. These data offer insights into the characteristics of childhood-onset CA in the Japanese population.",0.9281586408615112,True

X-linked visceral heterotaxy 1,30632303,"<h4>Background</h4>Intestinal malrotation is a potentially life-threatening congenital anomaly due to the risk of developing midgut volvulus. The reported incidence is 0.2%-1% and both apparently hereditary and sporadic cases have been reported. Intestinal malrotation is associated with a few syndromes with known genotype but the genetic contribution in isolated intestinal malrotation has not yet been reported. Rare copy number variants (CNVs) have been implicated in many congenital anomalies, and hence we sought to investigate the potential contribution of rare CNVs in intestinal malrotation.<h4>Methods</h4>Analysis of array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) data from 47 patients with symptomatic intestinal malrotation was performed.<h4>Results</h4>We identified six rare CNVs in five patients. Five CNVs involved syndrome loci: 7q11.23 microduplication, 16p13.11 microduplication, 18q terminal deletion, HDAC8 (Cornelia de Lange syndrome type 5 and FOXF1) as well as one intragenic deletion in GALNT14, not previously implicated in human disease.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In the present study, we identified rare CNVs contributing pathogenic or potentially pathogenic alleles in five patients with syndromic intestinal malrotation, suggesting that CNV screening is indicated in intestinal malrotation with associated malformations or neurological involvements. In addition, we identified intestinal malrotation in two known syndromes (Cornelia de Lange type 5 and 18q terminal deletion syndrome) that has not previously been associated with gastrointestinal malformations.",0.9264078140258789,True
VACTERL association,32299903,"Second malignant neoplasms pose a concern for survivors of childhood cancer. We evaluated incidence, type and risk factors for second malignant neoplasms in patients included in Berlin-Frankfurt-Muenster protocols for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. 3590 patients <15 years of age at diagnosis registered between 01/1981 and 06/2010 were analyzed. Second malignant neoplasms were reported by the treating institutions and the German Childhood Cancer Registry. After median follow-up of 9.4 years (Quartile, Q1 6.7 and Q3 12.1) 95 second malignant neoplasms were registered (26 carcinomas including 9 basal cell carcinomas, 21 acute myeloid leukemias/myelodysplastic syndromes, 20 lymphoid malignancies, 12 CNS-tumors, and 16 other). Cumulative incidence at 20 years was 5.7±0.7%, standard incidence ratio excluding basal cell carcinomas was 19.8 (95% CI 14.5-26.5). Median time from initial diagnosis to second malignancy was 8.7 years (range: 0.2-30.3). Acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-type therapy, cumulative anthracycline dose, and cranial radiotherapy for brain tumor-development were significant risk factors in univariate analysis only. In multivariate analysis including risk factors significant in univariate analysis, female sex (HR 1.87, 95% CI 1.23-2.86, p=0.004), CNS-involvement (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.03-4.88, p=0.042), lymphoblastic lymphoma (HR 2.60, 95% CI 1.69-3.97, p<0.001), and cancer-predisposing condition (HR 11.2, 95% CI 5.52-22.75, p<0.001) retained an independent risk.

Hereditary antithrombin deficiency type I,30704423,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Globally, eye diseases are considered as one of the major contributors of nonfatal disabling conditions. In Bangladesh, 1.5% of adults are blind and 21.6% have low vision. Therefore, this paper aimed to identify the community-based prevalence and associated risk factors of eye diseases among slum dwellers of Dhaka city.<h4>Methods</h4>The study was carried out in two phases. In the first phase, a survey was conducted using multistage cluster sampling among 1320 households of three purposively selected slums in Dhaka city. From each household, one family member (≥ 18 years old) was randomly interviewed by trained data collectors using a structured questionnaire. After that, each of the participants was requested to take part in the second phase of the study. Following the request, 432 participants out of 1320 participants came into the tertiary care hospitals where they were clinically assessed by ophthalmologist for presence of eye diseases. A number of descriptive and inferential statistics were performed using Stata 13.<h4>Result</h4>The majority of total 432 study participants were female (68.6%), married (82.6%) and Muslim (98.8%). Among them almost all (92.8%) were clinically diagnosed with eye disease. The most prevalent eye diseases were refractive error (63.2%), conjunctivitis (17.1%), visual impairment (16.4%) and cataract (7.2%). Refractive error was found significantly associated with older age, female gender and income generating work. Cataract was found negatively associated with the level of education, however, opposite relationship was found between cataract and visual impairment.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study provides epidemiologic data on the prevalence of eye diseases among adult population in low-income urban community of Dhaka city. The high prevalence of refractive error, allergic conjunctivitis, visual impairment, and cataract among this group of people suggests the importance of increasing access to eye care services.",0.9256442785263062,True

This study examined the incidence of CMZ embryopathy in the Hong Kong Chinese population and the factors associated with its development.<h4>Methods</h4>Of the 145 pregnant women with hyperthyroidism managed from 2008 to 2010, 29 (20%) had taken CMZ during pregnancy. The presence and details of birth defects, the dosage of CMZ, and the period of exposure during pregnancy were examined in these 29 pregnancies. All cases of CMZ embryopathy in the English literature were reviewed in the same way.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 27 babies (93.1%) with known outcome, 3 had aplasia cutis and 1 had an omphalocele in addition, and 1 affected baby had a sibling with aplasia cutis and patent vitellointestinal duct. The incidence of CMZ embryopathy in our study group is 11.1%. Amongst the 21 cases of CMZ embryopathy in the literature, 85% were exposed to a CMZ dosage of ≥20 mg/day, and the minimum duration of exposure being 7 weeks from last menstrual period. The most common abnormality is ectodermal anomaly (62%), followed by oro-nasal anomaly (48%), facial dysmorphism (38%), gastrointestinal anomaly (33%) and abdominal wall defect (19%). There was no relationship between the type of abnormality and the dosage or duration of exposure to CMZ.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The incidence of CMZ embryopathy in our study group is 11.1%. Critical factors for its development are exposure to a CMZ dosage of ≥20 mg/day before 7 weeks of gestation. Genetic susceptibility may also play a role.",0.9248912334442139,True

Immunopathological manifestations seem prevalent and increase the morbimortality. To assess the frequency and severity of the manifestations, we measured the prevalence of immunopathological manifestations as well as genotype-phenotype correlations in KS individuals from a registry.<h4>Methods</h4>Data were for 177 KS individuals with KDM6A or KMT2D pathogenic variants. Questionnaires to clinicians were used to assess the presence of immunodeficiency and autoimmune diseases both on a clinical and biological basis.<h4>Results</h4>Overall, 44.1% (78/177) and 58.2% (46/79) of KS individuals exhibited infection susceptibility and hypogammaglobulinemia, respectively; 13.6% (24/177) had autoimmune disease (AID; 25.6% [11/43] in adults), 5.6% (10/177) with ≥2 AID manifestations. The most frequent AID manifestations were immune thrombocytopenic purpura (7.3% [13/177]) and autoimmune hemolytic anemia (4.0% [7/177]). Among nonhematological manifestations, vitiligo was frequent. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura was frequent with missense versus other types of variants (p = 0.027).<h4>Conclusion</h4>The high prevalence of immunopathological manifestations in KS demonstrates the importance of systematic screening and efficient preventive management of these treatable and sometimes life-threatening conditions.",0.9164983630180359,True

Pulmonary artery coming from the aorta,31793205,"<h4>Background</h4>Consanguineous marriages are common in the Middle East including the Gulf countries. The rate of consanguinity in Qatar is approximately 54%, which are mainly first cousins' marriages. Previous studies showed that consanguinity increases the prevalence of birth defects and other genetic disorders. Thus, we studied the effects of consanguinity in a cohort of subjects with certain genetic disorders in Qatar.<h4>Methods</h4>This cross-sectional study was conducted at two centers in Qatar (Hamad Medical Corporation ""HMC"" and Shafallah ""SC"") including 599 Qatari families with certain types of genetic and nongenetic anomalies.<h4>Results</h4>Consanguineous marriages were seen in 397 of 599 (66.2%) Qatari families and first cousin group counts for 65% in Qatari population. In the total cohort and at HMC, all consanguineous marriages had a significantly higher risk of Autosomal Recessive disorders than nonconsanguineous marriages (total cohort: odds ratio (OR) = 1.72; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.71; p = .02; HMC: OR = 2.98; 95% CI: 1.37, 6.09; p = .005). On the other hand, at HMC, nonconsanguinity was significantly related to chromosomal abnormality (OR = 6.36; 95% CI: 1.13, 35.85; p = .036).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our data suggest a significant role of parental consanguinity in increasing the prevalence of genetic disorders; mainly Autosomal Recessive disorders. Chromosomal abnormality disorders were significantly higher among nonconsanguineous marriages. These results help better inform policy makers on social, educational, and public health initiatives that might mitigate the impact of genetic disease in the Qatari society.",0.9142784476280212,True

Chromosome 17p13.1 deletion syndrome,31949957,"Context:Gestational trophoblastic disease (GTD) is a rare complication of pregnancy, ranging from molar pregnancy to choriocarcinoma. Twin pregnancies with GTD and coexisting normal fetus are extremely rare with an estimated incidence of 1 case per 22,000-100,000 pregnancies. Molecular mimicry between human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) leads to gestational trophoblastic hyperthyroidism (GTH) which is further associated with increased maternal and fetal complications. This is the first reported case in literature describing the delivery of a baby with biochemical euthyroid status following a twin pregnancy with hydatidiform mole (HM) associated with gestational trophoblastic hyperthyroidism (GTH). Case Description:A 24-year-old G4 P3 Caucasian female with twin gestation was admitted to hospital for gestation trophoblastic hyperthyroidism. She was later diagnosed to have twin pregnancy with complete mole and coexisting normal fetus complicated by gestational trophoblastic hyperthyroidism (GTH). Despite the risk associated with the continuation of molar pregnancy, per patient request, pregnancy was continued till viability of the fetus. The patient underwent cesarean section due to worsening preeclampsia and delivered a euthyroid baby at the 24th week of gestation. Conclusions:Twin pregnancy with gestational trophoblastic disease and coexisting normal fetus is associated with high risk of hyperthyroidism, and careful monitoring of the thyroid function test along with dose titration of thionamides is of utmost importance throughout the gestation. If normal thyroid hormone levels are maintained during the pregnancy, euthyroidism could be successfully achieved in the baby.",0.912037193775177,True
Subpulmonary stenosis,33848667,"<h4>Objectives</h4>A low serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level is an uncommon finding in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD). The prevalence of this finding and whether low ALP expression influences CLD remain to be determined. The objectives of this study were: (1) to document the prevalence of low serum ALP levels in adult CLD patients and (2) compare features of CLD in patients with low versus normal or elevated serum ALP levels.<h4>Methods</h4>An adult, outpatient liver disease database was searched for patients with low serum ALP levels (<40 IU/L). Hepatic inflammation, function, fibrosis and disease severity were determined by serum aminotransferases, albumin, bilirubin and INR levels, Fib-4 calculations and MELD scores respectively.<h4>Results</h4>Of 19,037 patients entered into the database, 47 (0.25%) had consistently low serum ALP levels, 51 (0.27%) low levels on the majority and 469 (2.44%) on the minority of determinations. Patients with consistently low levels were matched (1:2) by age, gender and nature of the underlying liver disease to patients with normal or elevated serum ALP levels. Matched patients with consistently low ALP levels had significantly lower serum aminotransferase and bilirubin levels at their initial visit and throughout the follow-up period (p < 0.05 respectively) while Fib-4 levels and MELD scores were similar at the initial and last follow-up visit.<h4>Conclusions</h4>These results establish the prevalence of low serum ALP levels in adult CLD patients and describe a hitherto unreported association between low serum ALP levels and less biochemical evidence of active disease.",0.9079469442367554,True

Familial hypersecretion of adrenal androgens,31345997,"<h4>Objectives</h4>Neonatal herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections are associated with high mortality and long-term morbidity. However, incidence is low and acyclovir, the treatment of choice, carries risk of toxicity. We aimed to increase the percentage of patients 0 to 60 days of age who are tested and treated for HSV in accordance with local guideline recommendations from 40% to 80%.<h4>Methods</h4>This quality improvement project took place at 1 freestanding children's hospital. Multiple plan-do-study-act cycles were focused on interventions aimed at key drivers including provider buy-in, guideline availability, and accurate identification of high-risk patients. A run chart was used to track the effect of interventions on the percentage managed per guideline recommendations over time by using established rules for determining special cause. Pre- and postimplementation acyclovir use was compared by using a χ<sup>2</sup> test. In HSV-positive cases, delayed acyclovir initiation, defined as >1 day from presentation, was tracked as a balancing measure.<h4>Results</h4>The median percentage of patients managed according to guideline recommendations increased from 40% to 80% within 8 months. Acyclovir use decreased from 26% to 7.9% (<i>P</i> < .001) in non-high-risk patients but did not change significantly in high-risk patients (73%-83%; <i>P</i> = .15). There were no cases of delayed acyclovir initiation in HSV-positive cases.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Point-of-care availability of an evidence-based guideline and interventions targeted at provider engagement improved adherence to a new guideline for neonatal HSV management and decreased acyclovir use in non-high-risk infants. Further study is necessary to confirm the safety of these recommendations in other settings.",0.9044030904769897,True

Enchondromatosis dwarfism deafness,34078418,"<h4>Background</h4>The European Rare Kidney Disease Reference Network (ERKNet) recently established ERKReg, a Web-based registry for all patients with rare kidney diseases. The main objectives of this core registry are to generate epidemiological information, identify current patient cohort for clinical research, explore diagnostic and therapeutic management practices, and monitor treatment performance and patient's outcomes. The registry has a modular design that allows to integrate comprehensive disease-specific registries as extensions to the core database. The diagnosis (Orphacode) and diagnostic information (clinical, imaging, histopathological, biochemical, immunological and genetic) are recorded. Anthropometric, kidney function, and disease-specific management and outcome items informing a set of 61 key performance indicators (KPIs) are obtained annually. Data quality is ensured by automated plausibility checks upon data entry and regular offline database checks prompting queries. Centre KPI statistics and benchmarking are calculated automatically.<h4>Results</h4>Within the first 24 months since its launch, 7607 patients were enrolled to the registry at 45 pediatric and 12 specialized adult nephrology units from 21 countries. A kidney disease diagnosis had been established in 97.1% of these patients at time of enrolment. While 199 individual disease entities were reported by Orphacode, 50% of the cohort could be classified with 11, 80% with 43 and 95% with 92 codes. Two kidney diagnoses were assigned in 6.5% of patients; 5.9% suffered from syndromic disease.

Oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum,21846383,"VACTERL/VATER association is typically defined by the presence of at least three of the following congenital malformations: vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheo-esophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb abnormalities. In addition to these core component features, patients may also have other congenital anomalies. Although diagnostic criteria vary, the incidence is estimated at approximately 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 40,000 live-born infants. The condition is ascertained clinically by the presence of the above-mentioned malformations; importantly, there should be no clinical or laboratory-based evidence for the presence of one of the many similar conditions, as the differential diagnosis is relatively large. This differential diagnosis includes (but is not limited to) Baller-Gerold syndrome, CHARGE syndrome, Currarino syndrome, deletion 22q11.2 syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Feingold syndrome, Fryns syndrome, MURCS association, oculo-auriculo-vertebral syndrome, Opitz G/BBB syndrome, Pallister-Hall syndrome, Townes-Brocks syndrome, and VACTERL with hydrocephalus. Though there are hints regarding causation, the aetiology has been identified only in a small fraction of patients to date, likely due to factors such as a high degree of clinical and causal heterogeneity, the largely sporadic nature of the disorder, and the presence of many similar conditions. New genetic research methods offer promise that the causes of VACTERL association will be better defined in the relatively near future. Antenatal diagnosis can be challenging, as certain component features can be difficult to ascertain prior to birth. The management of patients with VACTERL/VATER association typically centers around surgical correction of the specific congenital anomalies (typically anal atresia, certain types of cardiac malformations, and/or tracheo-esophageal fistula) in the immediate postnatal period, followed by long-term medical management of sequelae of the congenital malformations.

Lesch Nyhan syndrome,32959514,"<h4>Background</h4>21-Hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) caused by the CYP21A2 gene mutations is the most common form of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. It is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in defective synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone. The incidences of various CYP21A2 gene mutations and the genotype-phenotype correlations vary among different populations.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>The clinical and molecular data of 22 patients were analyzed in this study. All patients were recruited from the neonatal intensive care unit. Locus-specific polymerase chain reaction and Sanger sequencing were applied to identify gene micro-conversions, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification was used to detect large fragment deletions/conversions. Then, the genotypes were categorized in to Null, A, B, C, and D groups to analyze the relationships between genotypes and phenotypes.<h4>Results</h4>All 22 patients were classified into classic salt wasting form of 21-OHD. Molecular defects were detected in 44 alleles (100%). Micro-conversion mutation IVS2-13A/C>G (70.5%) is most common in our cohort, followed by large gene deletions and conversions (22.7%). The other mutations present were p.R357 W (4.5%) and E6 Cluster (2.3%). Genotypes of 22 patients (100%) were consistent with the predictive phenotypes.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In this study, we identified the mutation spectrum of CYP21A2 gene in Chinese patients, especially the younger age cohort in pediatrics.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,32306243,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic immune-mediated inflammatory spondyloarthropathy associated with psoriasis. PsA is frequently associated with metabolic disorders including, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus (DM). Type 2 DM is among the most common metabolic disorders, with a prevalence ranging from 2.4 to 14.8% in the general population.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a narrative review of the English-language studies from January 1989 to September 2019 investigating the risk of type 2 DM in patients with PsA, the pathogenic mechanism linking DM to PsA, and the effects on insulin sensitivity exerted by systemic therapies for PsA.<h4>Results</h4>The prevalence of type 2 DM in patients with PsA ranges from 6.1 to 20.2%, generally higher when compared to the general population. The higher risk of DM is reported in women with more severe forms of PsA. Elevated serum levels of adipokines, including TNF-α, which inhibits the autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor and suppresses the expression of glucose transporter 4, favor insulin resistance and could partially explain the association between PsA and DM. Moreover, adiponectin and omentin, with insulin-sensitizing and anti-atherogenic properties, are decreased in patients with PsA. Some of the treatments for PsA could affect the glucose homeostasis. Systemic corticosteroids are known to impair insulin resistance, whereas apremilast (phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitor) and TNF-α inhibitors could exert neutral effect or reduce the insulin-resistance. The role of IL-17 or IL-23 inhibitors has been marginally investigated.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Patients affected by PsA have a higher prevalence of type 2 DM compared with the general population. The mechanism linking PsA with DM has not been completely clarified, but some of the principal mediators could be TNF-α and adipokine, especially adiponectin and omentin. Apremilast and TNF-α inhibitor may have a favorable effect and could be safely used in patients with DM.",0.8980837464332581,True
Acute cholinergic dysautonomia,33809780,"Past studies strongly connected stool consistency-as measured by Bristol Stool Scale (BSS)-with microbial gene richness and intestinal inflammation, colonic transit time and metabolome characteristics that are of clinical relevance in numerous gastro intestinal conditions. While retention time, defecation rate, BSS but not water activity have been shown to account for BSS-associated inflammatory effects, the potential correlation with the strength of a gel in the context of intestinal forces, abrasion, mucus imprinting, fecal pore clogging remains unexplored as a shaping factor for intestinal inflammation and has yet to be determined. Our study introduced a minimal pressure approach (MP) by probe indentation as measure of stool material crosslinking in fecal samples. Results reported here were obtained from 170 samples collected in two independent projects, including males and females, covering a wide span of moisture contents and BSS. MP values increased exponentially with increasing consistency (i.e., lower BSS) and enabled stratification of samples exhibiting mixed BSS classes. A trade-off between lowest MP and highest dry matter content delineated the span of intermediate healthy density of gel crosslinks. The crossectional transects identified fecal surface layers with exceptionally high MP and of <5 mm thickness followed by internal structures with an order of magnitude lower MP, characteristic of healthy stool consistency. The MP and BSS values reported in this study were coupled to reanalysis of the PlanHab data and fecal 1H-NMR metabolomes reported before. The exponential association between stool consistency and MP determined in this study was mirrored in the elevated intestinal and also systemic inflammation and other detrimental physiological deconditioning effects observed in the PlanHab participants reported before. The MP approach described in this study can be used to better understand fecal hardness and its relationships to human health as it provides a simple, fine scale and objective stool classification approach for the characterization of the exact sampling locations in future microbiome and metabolome studies.",0.8980717658996582,True
X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy,33840518,"Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is a highly prevalent condition that is associated with significant morbidity. The causes of EDS are varied, and include inadequate sleep, sleep disordered breathing, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, and central disorders of hypersomnolence (narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, and Kleine-Levin syndrome). Additionally, EDS could represent a symptom of an underlying medical or psychiatric disorder. Assessment of EDS includes a thorough sleep, medical, and psychiatric history, targeted clinical examination, and appropriate use of actigraphy to measure sleep duration and sleep-wake patterns, polysomnography to assess for associated conditions such as sleep-related breathing disorders or other factors that might disrupt nighttime sleep, multiple sleep latency testing to ascertain objective sleepiness and diagnose central disorders of hypersomnolence, and measurement of cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 concentration. Treatment of EDS secondary to central disorders of hypersomnolence is primarily pharmacologic with wakefulness-promoting agents such as modafinil, stimulants such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, and newer agents specifically designed to improve wakefulness; behavioral interventions can provide a useful adjunct to pharmacologic treatment. When excessive sleepiness is secondary to other conditions, the treatment should focus on targeting the primary disorder.

Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome,34079376,"<h4>Purpose</h4>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic diseases. The aim was to validate diagnoses of IBD among patients aged 50+ years in the Danish National Patient Registry (NPR) by comparison with patient medical records.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Men and women in the Diet, Cancer and Health (DCH) cohort were linked to NPR, and cases with a diagnosis of IBD and their respective hospital records were identified. Validation was performed by comparing patient medical records with information on discharge diagnoses of IBD from the NPR.<h4>Results</h4>Of 57,053 individuals in the DCH-cohort, 339 were registered with an IBD diagnosis in NPR, with 277 (82%) records available for review. Among 277 patients, the positive predictive values (PPVs) of one CD or UC registration in NPR were 78% for IBD overall, 51% for CD and 54% for UC. One hundred fifty-seven patients had at least two CD and/or UC registrations with PPVs of 90% for IBD overall, 65% for CD and 73% for UC. One hundred and two patients had at least three registrations with PPVs of 97% for IBD overall, 75% for CD and 88% for UC. 96% were diagnosed at a specialized department. Other diagnoses coded as IBD mostly included microscopic colitis, irritable bowel syndrome and cancer.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Validity of IBD diagnoses in the registry of individuals aged 50+ years increased with the number of registrations. It is recommended that these results are taken into consideration in future studies, especially in epidemiology research using NPR as a data source for patients diagnosed with IBD.",0.8961665034294128,True
"Ichthyosis hystrix, Curth Macklin type",33773094,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Patients with Noonan and Williams-Beuren syndrome present similar facial phenotypes modulated by their ethnic background. Although distinctive facial features have been reported, studies show a variable incidence of those characteristics in populations with diverse ancestry. Hence, a differential diagnosis based on reported facial features can be challenging. Although accurate diagnoses are possible with genetic testing, they are not available in developing and remote regions.<h4>Methods</h4>We used a facial analysis technology to identify the most discriminative facial metrics between 286 patients with Noonan and 161 with Williams-Beuren syndrome with diverse ethnic background. We quantified the most discriminative metrics, and their ranges both globally and in different ethnic groups. We also created population-based appearance images that are useful not only as clinical references but also for training purposes. Finally, we trained both global and ethnic-specific machine learning models with previous metrics to distinguish between patients with Noonan and Williams-Beuren syndromes.<h4>Results</h4>We obtained a classification accuracy of 85.68% in the global population evaluated using cross-validation, which improved to 90.38% when we adapted the facial metrics to the ethnicity of the patients (p = 0.024).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our facial analysis provided for the first time quantitative reference facial metrics for the differential diagnosis Noonan and Williams-Beuren syndromes in diverse populations.",0.8955762982368469,True

The National ALS Registry (Registry) collects physical activity data from persons with ALS. <i>Objective:</i> To examine the association between vigorous VPA and early onset ALS, defined as a diagnosis before age 60, among patients enrolled in the Registry. VPA was defined as engaging in dynamic exercise for at least 10 minutes in a session that caused heavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate. <i>Methods:</i> A cross-sectional study was conducted of 5463 ALS patients with VPA history and 956 ALS patients who never engaged in VPA. Patient characteristics were collected via online surveys in the following areas: demographic, lifetime VPA history, and initial onset of symptoms. General linear modeling was used to estimate mean age of diagnosis and to compute 95% confidence intervals. <i>Results:</i> Patients who reported engaging in VPA at least moderately (three times a week) during early adulthood were more likely to have an ALS diagnosis earlier compared to patients who did not (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). After controlling for year of birth, statistically significant associations between those reporting VPA at age 15-24 and 25-34 and diagnosis of ALS earlier (<i>p</i> = 0.0009, <i>p</i> = 0.0144 respectively). <i>Conclusion:</i> Patients with ALS who had a history of VPA before age 35, were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with ALS before age 60 compared to patients with ALS who never engaged vigorously.

Pituitary dwarfism with large sella turcica,33506527,"<h4>Background</h4>Gastric enterochromaffin-like cell (ECL) tumours can occur in patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), especially in those affected by Zollinger Ellison syndrome (ZES). Since the prevalence of ECL lesions is not well defined yet, the present study evaluated the presence and extent of ECL lesions in MEN1 patients with and without ZES.<h4>Methods</h4>Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 patients being part of a regular screening program (2014-2018) underwent gastroduodenoscopies with biopsies of the stomach and determination of serum gastrin and chromogranin A levels. Haematoxylin- and immunostaining with chromogranin A, gastrin and VMAT I and II (vesicular monoamine transporter I and II) of the biopsies were performed.<h4>Results</h4>Thirty-eight MEN1 patients, of whom 16 (42%) were diagnosed and treated earlier for ZES, were analysed. In ten of 16 (62.5%) ZES patients, a locally scattered, mixed image of diffuse, linear and micronodular mild hyperplasia was present. In addition, two of these patients (13%) showed small (max 1.5 mm in size) intramucosal ECL tumours. Neither ECL changes, nor tumours were found in MEN1 patients without ZES (n = 22). In MEN1/ZES patients, the median serum gastrin level was significantly elevated compared to MEN1 patients without ZES (206 pg/ml vs. 30.5 pg/ml, p < .001). A subgroup analysis of the serum gastrin and chromogranin A levels of MEN1/ZES patients with or without ECL hyperplasia did not show significant differences (gastrin level: p = .302, chromogranin A: p = .464).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Enterochromaffin-like cell hyperplasia and gastric carcinoids occur only in MEN1 patients with ZES, but less frequently than reported.",0.8948941230773926,True

Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,29867716,"Maintaining proper eye alignment is necessary to generate a cohesive visual image. This involves the coordination of complex neural networks, which can become impaired by various neurodegenerative diseases. When the vergence system is affected, this can result in strabismus and disorienting diplopia. While previous studies have detailed the effect of these disorders on other eye movements, such as saccades, relatively little is known about strabismus. Here, we focus on the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and treatment of strabismus and disorders of vergence in Parkinson's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia, Huntington disease, and multiple system atrophy. We find that vergence abnormalities may be more common in these disorders than previously thought. In Parkinson's disease, the evidence suggests that strabismus is related to convergence insufficiency; however, it is responsive to dopamine replacement therapy and can, therefore, fluctuate with medication ""on"" and ""off"" periods throughout the day. Diplopia is also established as a side effect of deep brain stimulation and is thought to be related to stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus and extraocular motor nucleus among other structures. In regards to the spinocerebellar ataxias, oculomotor symptoms are common in many subtypes, but diplopia is most common in SCA3 also known as Machado-Joseph disease. Ophthalmoplegia and vergence insufficiency have both been implicated in strabismus in these patients, but cannot fully explain the properties of the strabismus, suggesting the involvement of other structures as well. Strabismus has not been reported as a common finding in Huntington disease or atypical parkinsonian syndromes and more studies are needed to determine how these disorders affect binocular alignment.",0.8939486145973206,True

Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy,34183532,"<h4>Background</h4>The evidence of an association between statins and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is heterogeneous and inconclusive.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed a population-based cohort study consisting of 974,304 statin initiators aged ≥40 years and 1,948,606 matched general population comparators identified from Danish, nationwide registries (1996-2016). We computed incidence rates and hazard ratios (HRs) of a first-time hospital-based diagnosis of ALS. HRs were controlled for sex, birth year, calendar year, medically diagnosed comorbidities, and concomitant medications.<h4>Results</h4>During a median follow-up of 7.7 years, 852 ALS events occurred among statin initiators (11.3 [95% CI: 10.6-12.1] events per 100,000 person-years) and 1,679 among non-initiators (11.4 [95% CI: 10.9-12.0] events per 100,000 person-years). The overall adjusted HR indicated a slight association between statin initiation and ALS (1.11 [95% CI: 1.00-1.23]. In the first year after initiation, the HR was 1.40 (95% CI: 1.09-1.79) for both sexes combined, 1.00 (95% CI: 0.70-1.42) for men, and 1.92 (95% CI: 1.30-2.82) for women. The associations diminished to approximately null after the first year of follow-up for both sexes combined and for men, but point estimates were above 1 for women until 10 years after initiation.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Statin initiation was largely unassociated with ALS diagnosis but was associated with an elevated risk of ALS in women, especially in the first year after initiation. The association could be explained by reverse causation, detection bias, early neurotoxic effects of statins that affect women more than men, or a combination thereof.",0.8936629891395569,True

Patients' records with at least one diagnosis code for dRTA, RTA, specific autoimmune diseases, or renal disorders recorded between January 1987 and November 2017 were obtained and analyzed. An algorithm was developed to detect potentially undiagnosed/miscoded dRTA, based on associated conditions and prescriptions. A total of 216 patients with diagnosis of RTA or dRTA were identified (with 98 linked to hospital data), and 447 patients were identified as having suspected dRTA. dRTA prevalence for 2017 was estimated between 0.46 (recorded cases, of which 22.1% were considered primary) and 1.60 when including suspected cases (7.6% primary) per 10,000 people.

Eunuchoidism familial hypogonadotropic,32924062,"There is an urgent public health need to better understand Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2/COVID-19, particularly how sequences of the viruses could lead to diverse incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in different countries. However, because of its unknown ancestors and hosts, elucidating the genetic variations of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been difficult. Without needing to know ancestors, we identified an uneven distribution of local genome similarities among the viruses categorized by geographic regions, and it was strongly correlated with incidence and mortality. To ensure unbiased and origin-independent analyses, we used a pairwise comparison of local genome sequences of virus genomes by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST). We found a strong statistical correlation between dominance of the SARS-CoV-2 in distributions of uneven similarities and the incidence and mortality of illness. Genomic annotation of the BLAST hits also showed that viruses from geographic regions with severe infections tended to have more dynamic genomic regions in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) and receptor-binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein (S protein). Dynamic domains in the S protein were also confirmed by a canyon region of mismatches coincident with RBM and RBD, without hits of alignments of 100% matching. Thus, our origin-independent analysis suggests that the dynamic and unstable SARS-CoV-2-RBD could be the main reason for diverse incidence and mortality of COVID-19 infection.",0.8874160051345825,True

They are rare tumors and their incidence is not well defined.<h4>Case presentation</h4>An 18-month-old male presenting with typical Cushingoid appearance (moon face, central obesity, hirsutism and growth arrest) was admitted for evaluation of endocrine problems. Subsequent laboratory studies revealed markedly elevated adrenocorticotropic (ACTH) and cortisol levels, as well as a hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis, these data are consistent with the diagnosis of Cushing's disease. He was treated with metyrapone to control hypercortisolemia. One month and a half later, a mass was detected in the abdomen by ultrasonography. An abdominal Computed tomography confirmed a large heterogeneous retroperitoneal mass with a significant amount of extension into surrounding structures which was removed by laparoscopic abdominal surgery. The patient's symptoms completely resolved and the ACTH and cortisol levels were also greatly reduced.

SS is an autosomal dominant connective tissue disorder characterized by almost complete penetrance. COL2A1 and COL11A1 are the two most common mutations seen in SS patients. SS often presents at birth with RS, which is characterized by the triad of micrognathia, glossoptosis, and tongue-based airway obstruction. MDO is one surgical intervention that has been shown to be successful in relieving tongue base obstruction and is the surgical intervention of choice for this condition.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients with a diagnosis of SS at a tertiary pediatric hospital between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2018. The included patient charts were reviewed for demographic information, SS mutation, and history of MDO. Forty-six patients had a clinical diagnosis of SS. Of those, 31 met inclusion criteria which involved having a molecular diagnosis of SS and sufficient follow up information to determine if MDO was indicated or performed. Twenty-two of the 31 included patients had a diagnosis of RS (70.96%). Thirteen of the 31 patients (41.94%) included in this study required MDO as a neonate.<h4>Results</h4>Fifty-percent of patients with type I (COL2A1) required MDO as a neonate compared to only 31% of patients with type II (COL11A1), though the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The findings of this study suggest that patients with type I mutation may have a higher incidence of MDO than patients with a type II mutation, though further research with larger sample sizes is needed. This information is helpful in counseling those with SS or family history of SS about what they can expect related to RS and need for MDO based on genetic findings.<h4>Level of evidence</h4>3.",0.8857348561286926,True
Q fever,34055993,"<h4>Background</h4>Vitiligo is a disfiguring skin disease with profound psychosocial impacts, such as anxiety, but the reported effect sizes of associations vary. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to quantify the strength of association between anxiety and vitiligo and to estimate the prevalence of anxiety among individuals with vitiligo.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic literature search was performed in five online databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO) from inception until March 20, 2020. All of the eligible studies were comprehensively reviewed, and all of the available data were analyzed according to our predefined criteria.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-one studies involving 3259 patients in 11 countries were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with the healthy control group, patients with vitiligo often had concomitant anxiety (OR = 6.14 [95% CI: 3.35-11.24], <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 30.1%). The pooled prevalence of anxiety in female patients was significantly higher than that in males (OR = 2.24 [95% CI: 1.31-3.84], <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.0%). Subgroup analysis showed that the pooled prevalence of clinical anxiety disorder and anxiety symptoms was 12% (95% CI: 7%-16%, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 76.3%) and 34% (95% CI: 21%-46%, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 94.7%), respectively. No publication bias has been detected by Begg's funnel plot and Egger's test.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Patients with vitiligo have high anxiety comorbidity, with female predominance. Dermatologists and psychiatrists should be vigilant to the presence of anxiety, apply appropriate interventions to reduce the psychological impacts in a timely manner, and thus promote recovery in vitiligo patients. However, due to some objective limitations (poor information about the OR and diversity in assessment tools among included studies), findings should be interpreted with caution.",0.8847647905349731,True
Papular mucinosis,23498563,"Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II (OMIM 210720) is a rare autosomal recessive condition frequently associated with early-onset cerebrovascular disease. Presymptomatic detection and intervention could prevent the adverse consequences associated with this. We reviewed published cases of microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type II to ascertain prevalence and characteristics of cerebrovascular disease and use these data to propose an evidence-based approach to cerebrovascular screening. Of 147 cases identified, 47 had cerebrovascular disease (32%), including occlusive arteriopathy (including moyamoya) and cerebral aneurysmal disease. Occlusive disease occurred in younger individuals, and progression can be both rapid and clinically silent. A reasonable screening approach would be magnetic resonance imaging and angiography of the cervical and intracranial circulation at diagnosis, repeated at yearly intervals until 10 years, and every 2 years thereafter, unless clinical concerns occur earlier. At present it would appear that this needs to be life-long.

Lelis syndrome,33656736,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a fatal complication of the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) which causes COVID-19 disease. Here, we performed a scoping review and meta-analysis including clinical studies on patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection with data on AKI assessment and characteristics, and the overall prevalence of AKI was estimated using a random-effects model. We identified 21 articles which passed the search criteria. All were quantitative observational studies which used a cross-sectional, retrospective, case report, or cohort methodology. This showed that aging, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, previous chronic disease, and other comorbidities were risk factors of AKI. Although the prevalence of proteinuria, hematuria, and increased serum creatinine was reported for up to 60% of the patients with COVID-19, the overall prevalence of AKI was estimated to be 8%. We conclude that although approximately two-thirds of patients with COVID-19 had symptoms of kidney damage, most of these did not meet the diagnostic criteria for AKI. Further studies should be performed to validate biomarkers for improved AKI diagnosis in COVID-19 patients and new treatment options are required to reduce the rate of mortality.",0.881405234336853,True
Neutrophil-specific granule deficiency,24952799,"<h4>Background</h4>Neurological involvement due to intraspinal extension in sacrococcygeal malignant germ cell tumors (SC-MGCTs) has rarely been reported.<h4>Aim</h4>To evaluate the incidence, presentation, management and the outcome of patients of SC-MGCT with intraspinal extension.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>Case records of all cases of SC-MGCT from 2001 to 2008, were reviewed to identify cases with vertebral involvement and intraspinal extension. They were evaluated in terms of their presentation, response to therapy, extent of surgical resection, recovery of neurological symptoms and outcome.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 31 cases of SC-MGCT, 5 (16%) had intraspinal extension. Age ranged from 12 to 84 months (median 24 months). Four patients had Altman type 4 disease (stage 4) and 1 had Altman type 3 (stage 3) disease. The intraspinal extension in all patients was detected on contrast CT scan. Patients presented with neurological symptoms in the form of lower limb paresis (80%), bowel and bladder (20%) incontinence. All the tumors responded to pre-operative chemotherapy. Gross complete local resection could be achieved in 4(80%). Neurological recovery was complete in all except for persisting neurogenic bladder in one.

X-linked visceral heterotaxy 1,30160829,"Pathogenic variants in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene are responsible for a broad spectrum of skeletal dysplasias, including achondroplasia (ACH). The classic phenotype of ACH is caused by two highly prevalent mutations, c.1138G > A and c.1138G > C (p.Gly380Arg). In the homozygous state, these variant results in a severe skeletal dysplasia, neurologic deficits, and early demise from respiratory insufficiency. Although homozygous biallelic mutations have been reported in patients with ACH in combination with hypochondroplasia or other dominant skeletal dysplasias, thus far, no cases of heterozygous biallelic pathogenic ACH-related variants in FGFR3 have been reported. We describe a novel phenotype of an infant with two ACH-related mutations in FGFR3, p.Gly380Arg and p.Ser344Cys. Discordant features from classic ACH include atypical radiographic findings, severe obstructive sleep apnea, and focal, migrating seizures. We also report the long-term clinical course of her father, who harbors the p.Ser344Cys mutation that has only been reported once previously in a Japanese patient.

Marshall syndrome,31441021,"<h4>Purpose of review</h4>The goal of the review is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying variation in human stature.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Human height is an anthropometric trait that varies considerably within human populations as well as across the globe. Historically, much research focus was placed on understanding the biology of growth plate chondrocytes and how modifications to core chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation pathways potentially shaped height attainment in normal as well as pathological contexts. Recently, much progress has been made to improve our understanding regarding the mechanisms underlying the normal and pathological range of height variation within as well as between human populations, and today, it is understood to reflect complex interactions among a myriad of genetic, environmental, and evolutionary factors. Indeed, recent improvements in genetics (e.g., GWAS) and breakthroughs in functional genomics (e.g., whole exome sequencing, DNA methylation analysis, ATAC-sequencing, and CRISPR) have shed light on previously unknown pathways/mechanisms governing pathological and common height variation. Additionally, the use of an evolutionary perspective has also revealed important mechanisms that have shaped height variation across the planet. This review provides an overview of the current knowledge of the biological mechanisms underlying height variation by highlighting new research findings on skeletal growth control with an emphasis on previously unknown pathways/mechanisms influencing pathological and common height variation. In this context, this review also discusses how evolutionary forces likely shaped the genomic architecture of height across the globe.",0.879532516002655,True
Lubinsky syndrome,33484323,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Angelman syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by cognitive disability, speech impairment, hyperactivity and seizures. Movement disorders have been reported in almost all AS subjects and they are described as ""tremulous movements of limbs, unsteadiness, clumsiness or quick, jerky motions"". The presence of dystonia has barely been mentioned in subjects with AS and has never been studied in detail. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the prevalence, clinical features and severity of dystonia in a series of adolescents and adults with AS.<h4>Methods</h4>Whole body video recordings of patients with genetically confirmed AS were evaluated. Dystonia was evaluated by mean of the movement subscale of Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFM).<h4>Results</h4>Forty-four subjects with AS were evaluated. Fourteen recordings were excluded due to poor cooperation. We finally analyzed data of 30 subjects (15 F) with a median age of 28 years (range 15-51). Dystonia was present in 28/30 (93.3%) subjects. Among these, dystonia involved the upper limbs in 28/28 (100%), lower limbs in 8/28 (28.5%), mouth in 7/28 (25%), neck in 3/28 (10.7%), trunk in 1/28 (3.6%). Severity of dystonia ranged from slight to moderate. There was a linear correlation between severity of dystonia and increasing age. There was no difference in terms of severity of dystonia among genetic subgroups.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Dystonia is a common and previously underrecognized clinical feature of adults and adolescents with AS.",0.8786013722419739,True
Tyrosinemia type 1,34204176,"Age-related bone disorders such as osteoporosis or osteoarthritis are a major public health problem due to the functional disability for millions of people worldwide. Furthermore, fractures are associated with a higher degree of morbidity and mortality in the long term, which generates greater financial and health costs. As the world population becomes older, the incidence of this type of disease increases and this effect seems notably greater in those countries that present a more westernized lifestyle. Thus, increased efforts are directed toward reducing risks that need to focus not only on the prevention of bone diseases, but also on the treatment of persons already afflicted. Evidence is accumulating that dietary lipids play an important role in bone health which results relevant to develop effective interventions for prevent bone diseases or alterations, especially in the elderly segment of the population. This review focuses on evidence about the effects of dietary lipids on bone health and describes possible mechanisms to explain how lipids act on bone metabolism during aging.

Giant platelet syndrome,32746746,"White-tailed deer (WTD) are abundant mammals widely distributed across the United States. As a result, WTD are considered to be excellent sentinels for detecting arboviral activity in certain geographic areas. Evidence of West Nile virus (WNV) antibody in WTD has been reported previously in several states. However, WNV infection in WTD has not been reported from Texas, where the incidence of human West Nile (WN) cases is among the highest in the United States. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of WNV antibody in WTD in central Texas. Sera samples (<i>n</i> = 644) were collected from deer during the fall and winter in western Travis County, Texas from 2014 to 2018 and tested for WNV immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody by an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). ELISA antibody-positive samples were further tested for WNV and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) antibodies by an 80% plaque-reduction neutralization tests (PRNT<sub>80</sub>). Overall, 9% (<i>n</i> = 58) and 0.31% (<i>n</i> = 2) of the deer samples had serological evidence of WNV and SLEV infections, respectively.

Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis,33731176,"<h4>Background</h4>Entamoeba species harbored by humans have different degrees of pathogenicity. The present study explores the intra- and interspecific diversity, phylogenetic relationships, prevalence and distribution of tetra- and octonucleated cyst-producing Entamoeba in different Brazilian regions.<h4>Methods</h4>Cross-sectional studies were performed to collect fecal samples (n = 1728) and sociodemographic data in communities located in four Brazilian biomes: Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, Cerrado, and Amazon. Fecal samples were subjected to molecular analysis by partial small subunit ribosomal DNA sequencing (SSU rDNA) and phylogenetic analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Light microscopy analysis revealed that tetranucleated cysts were found in all the studied biomes. The highest positivity rates were observed in the age group 6-10 years (23.21%). For octonucleated cysts, positivity rates ranged from 1 to 55.1%. Sixty SSU rDNA Entamoeba sequences were obtained, and four different species were identified: the octonucleated E. coli, and the tetranucleated E. histolytica, E. dispar, and E. hartmanni. Novel haplotypes (n = 32) were characterized; however, new ribosomal lineages were not identified. The Entamoeba coli ST1 subtype predominated in Atlantic Forest and Caatinga, and the ST2 subtype was predominant in the Amazon biome. E. histolytica was detected only in the Amazon biome. In phylogenetic trees, sequences were grouped in two groups, the first containing uni- and tetranucleated and the second containing uni- and octonucleated cyst-producing Entamoeba species. Molecular diversity indexes revealed a high interspecific diversity for tetra- and octonucleated Entamoeba spp. (H ± SD = 0.9625 ± 0.0126). The intraspecific diversity varied according to species or subtype: E. dispar and E. histolytica showed lower diversity than E. coli subtypes ST1 and ST2 and E. hartmanni.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Tetra- and octonucleated cyst-producing Entamoeba are endemic in the studied communities; E. histolytica was found in a low proportion and only in the Amazon biome. With regard to E. coli, subtype ST2 was predominant in the Amazon biome. The molecular epidemiology of Entamoeba spp. is a field to be further explored and provides information with important implications for public health.",0.8759146928787231,True

Progressive non-fluent aphasia,22441648,"<h4>Background</h4>Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the major manifestation of Q fever, an emerging disease in French Guiana. Consequently, the empirical antibiotherapy used for the treatment of CAP combines doxycycline and the recommended amoxicillin. Our objectives were to estimate the prevalence of Q fever pneumonia and to build a prediction rule to identify patients with Q fever pneumonia for empirical antibiotic guidance.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective case-control study was conducted on inpatients admitted with CAP in the Department of Infectious Diseases of Cayenne Hospital from 2004 to 2007. Serodiagnosis for Coxiella burnetii was performed for all patients. Risk factor analysis was performed using multivariate logistic regression, and a prognostic score was computed using bootstrap procedures. The score performance characteristics were used to choose the best prediction rule to identify patients with Q fever pneumonia.<h4>Results</h4>One hundred thirty-one patients with CAP were included and the Q fever pneumonia prevalence was 24.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17.1-31.9). In multivariate analysis, male sex, middle age (age, 30-60 years), headache, leukocyte count <10 × 10(9)/L and C-reactive protein level >185 mg/L were independently associated with Q fever pneumonia. Patients with a predictive score ≤3 had a low risk of Q fever pneumonia with a negative predictive value of 0.97 (95% CI, .90-1) and a sensitivity of 0.97 (95% CI, .89-1).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prediction rule described here accurately identifies patients with low risk of Q fever pneumonia and may help physicians to make more rational decisions about the empirical use of antibiotherapy.

Congenital mitral stenosis,20629132,"The parkinsonian syndromes comprise a highly heterogeneous group of disorders. Although 15 loci are linked to predominantly familial Parkinson's disease (PD), additional PD loci are likely to exist. We recently identified a multigenerational family of Danish and German descent in which five males in three generations presented with a unique syndrome characterized by parkinsonian features and variably penetrant spasticity for which X-linked disease transmission was strongly suggested (XPDS). Autopsy in one individual failed to reveal synucleinopathy; however, there was a significant four-repeat tauopathy in the striatum. Our objective was to identify the locus responsible for this unique parkinsonian disorder. Members of the XPDS family were genotyped for markers spanning the X chromosome. Two-point and multipoint linkage analyses were performed and the candidate region refined by analyzing additional markers. A multipoint LOD(max) score of 2.068 was obtained between markers DXS991 and DXS993. Haplotype examination revealed an approximately 20 cM region bounded by markers DXS8042 and DXS1216 that segregated with disease in all affected males and obligate carrier females and was not carried by unaffected at-risk males. To reduce the possibility of a false-positive linkage result, multiple loci and genes associated with other parkinsonian or spasticity syndromes were excluded. In conclusion, we have identified a unique X-linked parkinsonian syndrome with variable spasticity and four-repeat tau pathology, and defined a novel candidate gene locus spanning approximately 28 Mb from Xp11.2-Xq13.3.",0.8748151063919067,True

2q37 deletion syndrome,34181284,"<h4>Background</h4>Lichen scrofulosorum (LS) represents immunologic reaction to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen and presents with subtle, asymptomatic, grouped follicular papules over the trunk and shows good therapeutic response to antitubercular drugs.<h4>Objective</h4>To study the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of patients diagnosed with LS.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>A single-center retrospective review of patients diagnosed with LS from 1997 to 2018 was conducted. The data pertained to clinico-epidemiological profile, BCG vaccination, Mantoux positivity, laboratory investigations, coexistent focus of tuberculosis, and response to antitubercular treatment (ATT).<h4>Results</h4>LS cases constituted 15.2% (221/1458) of all the patients diagnosed with cutaneous tuberculosis (CTB). Of these, 156 (70.5%) were pediatric patients. All patients presented with multiple follicular and perifollicular grouped papules. The trunk was the most common site involved (98.6%), followed by lower limb (25.33%), upper limb (15.83%), face (5%), and external genitalia (3.6%). Evidence of BCG vaccination and Mantoux test positivity was observed in 52.03 and 83.2%, respectively. Coexistent TB focus was detected in 134 (60.6%) patients in lymph nodes, lungs, abdomen, and unusual sites such as intracranial, endometrium, and eye. Twenty-eight patients (12.66%) had coexistent other clinical forms of CTB. Clinical diagnosis of LS was confirmed on histology that revealed chiefly periappendageal epithelioid cell granuloma. Response to ATT was good with complete resolution of lesion in 8-12 weeks.<h4>Conclusion</h4>LS appears to be an underdiagnosed entity. Subtle and asymptomatic lesions of LS are often missed, thereby necessitating a high index of suspicion and appropriate evaluation of the underlying TB focus.",0.8737559914588928,True
Autosomal recessive palmoplantar keratoderma and congenital alopecia,29797470,"AIM:The aim of this study was to develop an algorithm to prompt early clinical suspicion of mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I). METHODS:An international working group was established in 2016 that comprised 11 experts in paediatrics, rare diseases and inherited metabolic diseases. They reviewed real-world clinical cases, selected key signs or symptoms based on their prevalence and specificity and reached consensus about the algorithm. The algorithm was retrospectively tested. RESULTS:An algorithm was developed. In patients under two years of age, kyphosis or gibbus deformity were the key symptoms that raised clinical suspicion of MPS I and in those over two years they were kyphosis or gibbus deformity, or joint stiffness or contractures without inflammation. The algorithm was tested on 35 cases, comprising 16 Hurler, 10 Hurler-Scheie, and nine Scheie patients. Of these 35 cases, 32 (91%) - 16 Hurler, nine Hurler-Scheie and seven Scheie patients - would have been referred earlier if the algorithm had been used. CONCLUSION:The expert panel developed and tested an algorithm that helps raise clinical suspicion of MPS I and would lead to a more prompt final diagnosis and allow earlier treatment.",0.8727340698242188,True
Snyder-Robinson syndrome,31448121,"<h4>Background</h4>Tuberculosis osteomyelitis is rarely seen in the diaphyseal bones. It may be confused with Brodie's abscess due to similar clinical, radiological and laboratory findings. Late diagnosis of the disease causes bone destruction. Tuberculosis osteomyelitis of the bone is a rare condition caused by the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. Its incidence has increased in Western countries in recent years due to HIV infection, increasing elderly population and emerging resistant strains. The slow progress of tuberculous osteomyelitis, due to lack of significant elevations in the laboratory values and changes in the radiographic appearance, often leads to confusion with the subtypes of subacute osteomyelitis, defined as Brodie's abscess. These two low-virulence clinical cases often lead to delays in diagnosis and progressive bone destruction.<h4>Case presentation</h4>We report a 65-year-old male patient who presented to our clinic with pain, swelling and sensitivity in the left leg. Diagnosed with infection in the tibia, the patient had undergone antibiotherapy. However, the patient's symptoms were not resolved and we performed bone curettage and cementation. <i>M. tuberculosis</i>-specific DNA was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction and the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> complex was produced from the perioperative samples.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In conclusion, histopathological examination and polymerase chain reaction are essential before surgery of subacute and chronic osteomyelitis with atypical clinical, laboratory and radiological findings for early diagnosis and accurate treatment.",0.8721560835838318,True

The recent discovery in 2006 of the genetic defect antiquitin (ALDH7A1, OMIM #266100) has helped to understand the underlying mechanism, which is the accumulation of neurotoxic intermediates in the lysine catabolic pathway. The goal of the new therapeutic approach, termed triple therapy (TT) (pyridoxine, lysine-restricted diet and arginine supplementation), is to improve epilepsy control and neurocognitive development in patients with PDE. We present the 3-year treatment outcome for a child with PDE on pyridoxine treatment (started at age 5 months), lysine-restricted diet (started at age 17 months) and arginine supplementation therapy (started at age 19 months). The TT was well-tolerated with good compliance. No adverse events were reported.

Updated statistical data are not complete in the North East region of Romania and need to be improved. Therefore, through this study, we aim to renew the existing data on thyroid cancer. We conducted a retrospective study covering a period of 10 years. Data were collected from a hospital information system (InfoWorld) between 2009 and 2019. Patients' age groups were stratified in relation with the age at the moment of the Chernobyl event. A database was obtained (Microsoft Excel) and statistical correlations were applied. In the studied period, 1159 patients were diagnosed: 968 females and 191 males, distributed by region, with the highest addressability in Iasi (529), followed by neighboring counties. Age distribution displayed that most of the thyroid cancers were in the range 4060 years old (50.94%), followed by 60-80 years old (32.41%). Most patients were diagnosed with papillary carcinoma 63.10%, then follicular 14.7%, medullary 6.74% and undifferentiated 1.02%. Romania was in the vicinity of the radioactive cloud at Chernobyl fallout, so we must deliberate whether the increased incidence of thyroid cancer in the age group 40-60 years is associated with radiogenicity (iodine 131) given the fact that over has 35 years and the half-life of other radioisotopes like Caesium-137 and Strontium -90 is completed.",0.8709896802902222,True
Acute monoblastic leukemia,34095011,"Dyslipidemia is a major cause of cardiovascular diseases which represent a leading cause of death in humans.

Conversely, dyslipidemia is known to be tightly associated with immune disorders in humans, as evidenced by a higher incidence of atherosclerosis in patients with autoimmune diseases including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Given that the dyslipidemia-related autoimmune diseases are caused by autoreactive T cells and B cells, dyslipidemia seems to directly or indirectly regulate the adaptive immunity. Indeed, accumulating evidence has unveiled that proatherogenic factors can impact the differentiation and function of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, and B cells.

Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome,33079792,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To compare clinical outcomes between pars plana vitrectomy (PPV), scleral buckling (SB), and PPV+SB for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment in the Japan-RD Registry.<h4>Methods</h4>This is a nation-wide, multicenter, observational study based on the registry data between 2016 and 2017. The failure levels were defined as Level 1 (a failure of retinal detachment repair), Level 2 (remaining silicone oil), and Level 3 (multiple surgeries to achieve reattachment). We compared cases treated by SB or PPV in the subgroup of simple rhegmatogenous retinal detachment using multivariate Cox proportional hazard models.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 2,775 cases were included. Overall, 6 months any levels of failure in total, SB, PPV, and PPV+SB were 9.2% (n = 256), 6.9% (n = 48), 8.2% (n = 157), and 21.3% (n = 51), respectively. Poor visual acuity at baseline in SB and inferior rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and larger retinal tear in PPV were associated with a higher risk of failure. Pars plana vitrectomy was associated with a higher chance of achieving primary success in cases with simple RRD, especially for cases with superior RRD (adjusted hazard ratio 3.61, 95% confidence interval 2.22-5.94, P < 0.001).<h4>Conclusion</h4>In this nationwide study, surgical anatomic outcomes were equally successful in either SB or PPV.

Lelis syndrome,33919254,"This article reports the intent to receive a SARS-COV-2 vaccine, its predictors and willingness to pay in Bangladesh. We carried out an online cross-sectional survey of 697 adults from the general population of Bangladesh in January 2021. A structured questionnaire was used to assess vaccination intent. The questionnaire included sociodemographic variables and health belief model constructs which may predict vaccination intent. Among the participants, 26% demonstrated a definite intent, 43% probable intent, 24% probable negative, and 7% a definite negative intention. Multivariable logistic regression analyses suggest an association between definite intent and previous COVID-19 infection (OR: 2.86; 95% CI: 1.71-4.78), perceiving COVID-19 as serious (OR: 1.93; 1.04-3.59), the belief that vaccination would make them feel less worried about catching COVID-19 (OR: 4.42; 2.25-8.68), and concerns about vaccine affordability (OR: 1.51; 1.01-2.25). Individuals afraid of the side effects (OR: 0.34; 0.21-0.53) and those who would take the vaccine if the vaccine were taken by many others (OR: 0.44; 0.29-0.67) are less likely to have a definite intent. A definite negative intent is associated with the concern that the vaccine may not be halal (OR: 2.03; 1.04-3.96). Furthermore, 68.4% are willing to pay for the vaccine. The median amount that they are willing to pay is USD 7.08.

OAT is mainly involved in ornithine catabolism in adults, thus explaining the hyperornithinemia as hallmark of the disease. Patients are treated with an arginine-restricted diet, to limit ornithine load, or the administration of Vitamin B6, a precursor of the OAT coenzyme pyridoxal phosphate. Although the clinical and genetic aspects of GA are known for many years, the enzymatic phenotype of pathogenic variants and their response to Vitamin B6, as well as the molecular mechanisms explaining retinal damage, are poorly clarified.

Absence of gluteal muscle,21278390,"<h4>Background</h4>Congenital malformations involving the Müllerian ducts are observed in around 5% of infertile women. Complete aplasia of the uterus, cervix, and upper vagina, also termed Müllerian aplasia or Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, occurs with an incidence of around 1 in 4500 female births, and occurs in both isolated and syndromic forms. Previous reports have suggested that a proportion of cases, especially syndromic cases, are caused by variation in copy number at different genomic loci.<h4>Methods</h4>In order to obtain an overview of the contribution of copy number variation to both isolated and syndromic forms of Müllerian aplasia, copy number assays were performed in a series of 63 cases, of which 25 were syndromic and 38 isolated.<h4>Results</h4>A high incidence (9/63, 14%) of recurrent copy number variants in this cohort is reported here. These comprised four cases of microdeletion at 16p11.2, an autism susceptibility locus not previously associated with Müllerian aplasia, four cases of microdeletion at 17q12, and one case of a distal 22q11.2 microdeletion. Microdeletions at 16p11.2 and 17q12 were found in 4/38 (10.5%) cases with isolated Müllerian aplasia, and at 16p11.2, 17q12 and 22q11.2 (distal) in 5/25 cases (20%) with syndromic Müllerian aplasia.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The finding of microdeletion at 16p11.2 in 2/38 (5%) of isolated and 2/25 (8%) of syndromic cases suggests a significant contribution of this copy number variant alone to the pathogenesis of Müllerian aplasia. Overall, the high incidence of recurrent copy number variants in all forms of Müllerian aplasia has implications for the understanding of the aetiopathogenesis of the condition, and for genetic counselling in families affected by it.",0.8679577708244324,True

Articles published from Dec 2019 to April 2020 were included. All cross-sectional, retrospective or prospective observational cohort and case-control studies were selected which reported the incidence or prevalence of myocardial injury, myocardial infarction, or cardiovascular disease in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Based on the inclusion criteria, 12 articles were selected. The incidence of cardiac injury was reported in 8 articles and 8 articles focused on the cardiovascular outcomes of COVID-19 infection. The incidence of new cardiac injury was reported to be 7.2-77% in live and dead patients, respectively. The results showed that patients with cardiac injury had worse outcomes including higher mortality than those without cardiac injury. The most common cardiac injury outcomes were shock and malignant arrhythmias. The most common radiographic findings in patients with cardiac injury were multiple mottling and ground-glass opacities in the lungs (64.6%). A significant number of patients with cardiac injury required noninvasive mechanical ventilation (46.3%) or invasive mechanical ventilation (22.0%). Acute respiratory distress syndrome was seen in 58.5%, acute kidney injury in 8.5%, electrolyte disturbances in 15.9%, hypoproteinemia in 13.4%, and coagulation disorders in 7.3% of patients with cardiac injuries. In addition, survival days were negatively correlated with cardiac troponin I levels (r = -0.42, 95%, p = 0.005).

Schrander-Stumpel Theunissen Hulsmans syndrome,32367336,"Despite numerous studies in the field of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, some clinical variability of the presentation and discrepancies in the genotype/phenotype correlation are still unexplained. Some, but not all, discordant phenotypes caused by mutations with known enzyme activity have been explained by in silico structural changes in the 21-hydroxylase protein. The incidence of P30L mutation varies in different populations and is most frequently found in several Central and Southeast European countries as well as Mexico. Patients carrying P30L mutation present predominantly as non-classical CAH; however, simple virilizing forms are found in up to 50% of patients. Taking into consideration the residual 21-hydroxulase activity present with P30L mutation this is unexpected. Different mechanisms for increased androgenization in patients carrying P30L mutation have been proposed including influence of different residues, accompanying promotor allele variability or mutations, and individual androgene sensitivity. Early diagnosis of patients who would present with SV is important in order to improve outcome. Outcome studies of CAH have confirmed the uniqueness of this mutation such as difficulties in phenotype classification, different fertility, growth, and psychologic issues in comparison with other genotypes.

Aminoaciduria,33747004,"Grafting watermelon scions to interspecific squash hybrids has been found to increase fruit firmness. Triploid (seedless) watermelon are prone to hollow heart (HH), an internal fruit disorder characterized by a crack in the placental tissue expanding to a cavity. Although watermelon with lower tissue firmness tend to have a higher HH incidence, associated differences in cell wall polysaccharide composition are unknown. Grafting ""Liberty"" watermelon to ""Carnivor"" (interspecific hybrid rootstock, <i>C. moschata</i> × <i>C. maxima)</i> reduced HH 39% and increased tissue firmness by 3 N. Fruit with and without severe HH from both grafted and non-grafted plants were analyzed to determine differences in cell wall polysaccharides associated with grafting and HH. Alcohol insoluble residues (AIR) were sequentially extracted from placental tissue to yield water soluble (WSF), carbonate soluble (CSF), alkali soluble (ASF), or unextractable (UNX) pectic fractions. The CSF was lower in fruit with HH (24.5%) compared to those without HH (27.1%). AIRs were also reduced, hydrolyzed, and acetylated for GC-MS analysis of monosaccharide composition, and a portion of each AIR was methylated prior to hydrolysis and acetylation to produce partially methylated alditol acetates for polysaccharide linkage assembly. No differences in degree of methylation or galacturonic and glucuronic acid concentrations were found. Glucose and galactose were in highest abundance at 75.9 and 82.4 μg⋅mg<sup>-1</sup> AIR, respectively, followed by xylose and arabinose (29.3 and 22.0 μg⋅mg<sup>-1</sup>). Mannose was higher in fruit with HH (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and xylose was highest in fruit from grafted plants (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Mannose is primarily found in heteromannan and rhamnogalacturonan I side chains, while xylose is found in xylogalacturonan or heteroxylan. In watermelon, 34 carbohydrate linkages were identified with galactose, glucose, and arabinose linkages in highest abundance. This represents the most comprehensive polysaccharide linkage analysis to date for watermelon, including the identification of several new linkages.

Although a few candidate genes and genomic domains for have been reported for MRKH, the genetic underpinnings remain largely unknown. Some of the top candidate genes are WNT4, HNF1B, and LHX1. The goals of this study were to: 1) determine the prevalence of WNT4, HNF1B, and LHX1 point mutations, as well as new copy number variants (CNVs) in people with MRKH; and 2) identify and characterize MRKH cohorts.<h4>Design</h4>Laboratory- and community-based study.<h4>Setting</h4>Academic medical centers.<h4>Patient(s)</h4>A total of 147 MRKH probands and available family members.<h4>Interventions(s)</h4>DNA sequencing of WNT4, HNF1B, and LHX1 in 100 MRKH patients, chromosomal microarray analysis in 31 North American MRKH patients, and characterization and sample collection of 147 North American and Turkish MRKH probands and their families.<h4>Main outcome measure(s)</h4>DNA sequence variants and CNVs; pedigree structural analysis.<h4>Result(s)</h4>We report finding CNVs in 6/31 people (∼19%) with MRKH, but no point mutations or small indels in WNT4, HNF1B, or LHX1 in 100 MRKH patients. Our MRKH families included 43 quads, 26 trios, and 30 duos. Of our MRKH probands, 87/147 (59%) had MRKH type 1 and 60/147 (41%) had type 2 with additional anomalies.<h4>Conclusion(s)</h4>Although the prevalence of WNT4, HNF1B, and LHX1 point mutations is low in people with MRKH, the prevalence of CNVs was ∼19%. Further analysis of our large familial cohort of patients will facilitate gene discovery to better understand the complex etiology of MRKH.",0.8598915338516235,True
"Clasped thumbs, congenital",34169194,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a proven therapy for reducing cardiovascular death and hospitalization. Whether CR participation is associated with improved outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unknown.<h4>Methods</h4>We obtained data on all adult patients in Calgary, Alberta, Canada with angiographically proven coronary artery disease from 1996 to 2016 referred to CR from The Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease and TotalCardiology Rehabilitation. An estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> or kidney replacement therapy defined CKD. Predictors of CR use were estimated with multinomial logistic regression. The association between starting versus not starting and completion versus noncompletion of CR and clinical outcomes were estimated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models.<h4>Results</h4>Of 23,215 patients referred to CR, 12,084 were eligible for inclusion. Participants with CKD (N = 1322) were older, had more comorbidity, lower exercise capacity on graded treadmill testing, and took longer to be referred and to start CR than those without CKD. CKD predicted not starting CR: odds ratio 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-0.83). Over a median 1 year follow-up, there were 146 deaths, 40 (0.3%) from CKD and 106 (1.0%) not from CKD. Similar to those without CKD, the risk of death was lower in CR completers (hazard ratio [HR] 0.24 [95% CI 0.06-0.91) and starters (HR 0.56 [95% CI 0.29- 1.10]) with CKD.<h4>Conclusion</h4>CR participation was associated with comparable benefits in people with moderate CKD as those without who survived to CR. Lower rates of CR attendance in this high-risk population suggest that strategies to increase CR utilization are needed.",0.8592085838317871,True
Primary orthostatic tremor,33337500,"Premature loss of ovarian activity before 40 years of age is known as primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) and occurs in ∼1% of women. A more subtle decline in ovarian activity, known as premature ovarian ageing (POA), occurs in ∼10% of women. Despite the high prevalence of POA, very little is known regarding its genetic causation. Senataxin (SETX) is an RNA/DNA helicase involved in repair of oxidative stress-induced DNA damage. Homozygous mutation of SETX leads to the neurodegenerative disorder, ataxia oculomotor apraxia type 2 (AOA2). There have been reports of POI in AOA2 females suggesting a link between SETX and ovarian ageing. Here, we studied female mice lacking either one (Setx+/-) or both (Setx-/-) copies of SETX over a 12- to 14-month period. We find that DNA damage is increased in oocytes from 8-month-old Setx+/- and Setx-/- females compared with Setx+/+ oocytes leading to a marked reduction in all classes of ovarian follicles at least 4 months earlier than typically occurs in female mice. Furthermore, during a 12-month long mating trial, Setx+/- and Setx-/- females produced significantly fewer pups than Setx+/+ females from 7 months of age onwards. These data show that SETX is critical for preventing POA in mice, likely by preserving DNA integrity in oocytes.

Linear lichen planus,32437676,"<h4>Background</h4>Given recent reports of percutaneous closure of sinus venosus atrial septal defects, we reviewed our experience with surgical repair. Owing to the high incidence of arrhythmias with the two-patch technique, since 2001 we have used either one-patch repairs or the Warden procedure.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective review was performed of pediatric patients undergoing sinus venosus atrial septal defect repair at our institution from January 1, 1990, to July 1, 2018. Standard demographic data such as echocardiographic and cross-sectional imaging along with operative details and clinical echocardiographic outcomes were collected.<h4>Results</h4>The cohort included 144 patients with a median age of 4.3 years (interquartile range, 8.5). Inferior SVASD was present in 24 patients (17%). A single autologous untreated pericardial patch was used for 114 patients (79%), a two-patch technique for 20 patients (14%, last performed in 2000), and a Warden procedure in 10 patients (7%). Median length of stay was 4 days (interquartile range, 2). On echocardiogram follow-up, no patient had pulmonary vein stenosis. One patient who had the Warden procedure required a balloon dilation of the superior caval vein 2 years postoperatively and a stent 3 years later. Two-patch patients were substantially less likely to be in normal sinus rhythm (41%) on postoperative electrocardiograms compared with the other two techniques (81% one-patch and 89% Warden, P = .02).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The great majority of patients with sinus venosus atrial septal defects can be successfully repaired with a single patch of autologous pericardium. We transitioned to using either a single pericardial patch or the Warden procedure, resulting in a higher frequency of normal sinus rhythm on postoperative electrocardiograms.",0.8581651449203491,True
Congenital vagal hyperreflexivity,34160680,"<h4>Objective</h4>Tarsal coalition is known to cause abnormal talocrural stress, hindfoot malalignment, and ankle sprains. These can all be associated with osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) of the talar dome. We present the first detailed description of a series of talar OCDs occurring in patients with tarsal coalition, with the goal of determining whether there is an increased prevalence of OCDs among patients with tarsal coalition.<h4>Materials and methods</h4>We studied ankle MRIs in 57 patients with tarsal coalitions, excluding those with a reported inciting traumatic event. The MRIs were performed on magnetic field strengths ranging from 0.3 to 1.5 T and included axial, coronal, and sagittal T1 and T2 or PD fat-suppressed sequences. We evaluated the morphology and location of classically described OCDs in these patients, type and location of concomitant tarsal coalition, and, when available, the presence of pes planus and hindfoot valgus on weight-bearing radiographs. Chi-squared analysis was used to compare categorical variables and a Student's t test was used for parametric continuous variables. Additionally, logistic regression was used to compute the odds ratio of talar OCD associated with patient age, gender, laterality, pes planus status, hindfoot valgus status, and coalition type.<h4>Results</h4>Eighty-nine percent of tarsal coalitions were non-osseous coalitions and the calcaneonavicular space was the most common site of abnormal tarsal connection (54.4%). In the 29 patients with tarsal coalitions and talar OCDs, OCDs commonly occurred medially (75.9%). In the sagittal plane, talar OCDs occurred centrally, with only one case sparing the central talar dome. The mean surface area of the 29 OCDs was 89.7 mm<sup>2</sup>. Both osseous coalition and hindfoot valgus were associated with smaller talar OCD mean surface area (p = 0.015 and p = 0.0001, respectively). There was no association between depth and surface area of talar OCD with either coalition location or presence of pes planus (coalition location: p = 0.455 for depth and p = 0.295 for surface area; presence of pes planus: p = 0.593 for depth and p = 0.367 for surface area).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Talar OCD prevalence is higher in patients with tarsal coalition than that reported for the general population. This occurrence may relate to altered biomechanics and repetitive talocrural stress owing to altered subtalar motion, particularly given the findings of increased odds of talar OCD in older patients, as well as weak associations between OCD surface area and both non-osseous coalition and hindfoot alignment. However, we did not find any specific OCD morphologic features attributable to the precise location of the tarsal coalition.",0.8580812215805054,True
Optic atrophy polyneuropathy deafness,33843445,"West Nile virus (WNV) is a flavivirus which transmission cycle is maintained between mosquitoes and birds, although it occasionally causes sporadic outbreaks in horses and humans that can result in serious diseases and even death. Since its first isolation in Africa in 1937, WNV had been considered a neglected pathogen until its recent spread throughout Europe and the colonization of America, regions where it continues to cause outbreaks with severe neurological consequences in humans and horses. Although our knowledge about the characteristics and consequences of the virus has increased enormously lately, many questions remain to be resolved. Here, we thoroughly update our knowledge of different aspects of the WNV life cycle: virology and molecular classification, host cell interactions, transmission dynamics, host range, epidemiology and surveillance, immune response, clinical presentations, pathogenesis, diagnosis, prophylaxis (antivirals and vaccines), and prevention, and we highlight those aspects that are still unknown and that undoubtedly require further investigation.",0.857354998588562,True
Infantile onset spinocerebellar ataxia,33475036,"<h4>Background</h4>Q fever osteoarticular infections are a rare complication of the chronic form of Q fever. We aimed to characterize chronic Q fever vertebral osteomyelitis through our experience and a review of the literature.<h4>Methods</h4>Four adult patients with Q fever vertebral osteomyelitis diagnosed in a tertiary hospital in northern Israel between 2016 to 2020 are described. In addition, a 30 years' literature review of Q fever vertebral osteomyelitis, characterizing predisposing factors, clinical presentation, course of disease, treatment and outcomes, was performed.<h4>Results</h4>Thirty-four adult patients with Q fever vertebral osteomyelitis were identified. The vast majority were male (30/34, 88%) with a mean age of 67.2 ± 10 years. Involvement of the adjacent aorta, likely the origin of the infection, was observed in 23/34 (68%) of the patients, usually among patients with aortic graft or aneurysm. Clinical presentation was insidious and fever was frequently absent. Delayed diagnosis for months to years after symptoms onset was frequently reported. Vascular infections were managed with or without extraction of the infected aneurysm/aorta and graft placement. The outcome was variable with limited follow-up data in most cases. Patients were usually treated with prolonged antimicrobial therapy, most commonly doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine combination therapy.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Q fever should be included in the differential diagnosis of vertebral osteomyelitis in endemic settings, in particular when concomitant adjacent vascular infection exists.",0.85707688331604,True
Craniosynostosis contractures cleft,20696635,"<h4>Objective</h4>Non-operative management of blunt splenic injury in adults has been applied increasingly at the end of the last century. Therefore, the lifelong risk of overwhelming post-splenectomy infection has been the major impetus for preservation of the spleen. However, the prevalence of posttraumatic infection after splenectomy in contrast to a conservative management is still unknown. Objective was to determine if splenectomy is an independent risk factor for the development of posttraumatic sepsis and multi-organ failure.<h4>Methods</h4>13,433 patients from 113 hospitals were prospective collected from 1993 to 2005. Patients with an injury severity score >16, no isolated head injury, primary admission to a trauma center and splenic injury were included. Data were allocated according to the operative management into 2 groups (splenectomy (I) and conservative managed patients (II)).<h4>Results</h4>From 1,630 patients with splenic injury 758 patients undergoing splenectomy compared with 872 non-splenectomized patients. 96 (18.3%) of the patients with splenectomy and 102 (18.5%) without splenectomy had apparent infection after operation. Additionally, there was no difference in mortality (24.8% versus 22.2%) in both groups. After massive transfusion of red blood cells (>10) non-splenectomy patients showed a significant increase of multi-organ failure (46% vs. 40%) and sepsis (38% vs. 25%).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Non-operative management leads to lower systemic infection rates and mortality in adult patients with moderate blunt splenic injury (grade 1-3) and should therefore be advocated. Patients with grade 4 and 5 injury, patients with massive transfusion of red blood cells and unstable patients should be managed operatively.",0.8570600152015686,True
Giant platelet syndrome,32405525,"West Nile virus (WNV) is a zoonotic mosquito-borne flavivirus that is harbored and amplified by wild birds via the enzootic transmission cycle. Wide range of hosts are found to be susceptible to WNV infection including mammals, amphibians and reptiles across the world. Several studies have demonstrated that WNV was present in the Malaysian Orang Asli and captive birds. However, no data are available on the WNV prevalence in wild birds found in Malaysia. Therefore this study was conducted to determine the serological and molecular prevalence of WNV in wild birds in selected areas in the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. Two types of wild birds were screened, namely migratory and resident birds in order to explore any possibility of WNV transmission from the migratory birds to the resident birds. Thus, a cross-sectional study was conducted at the migratory birds sanctuary located in Kuala Gula, Perak and Kapar, Selangor by catching 163 migratory birds, and 97 resident birds from Kuala Gula and Parit Buntar, Perak at different time between 2016 and 2017 (Total, n = 260). Blood and oropharyngeal swabs were collected for serological and molecular analysis, respectively. Serum were screened for WNV antibodies using a commercial competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) (ID Screen® West Nile Competition Multi-species ELISA, ID VET, Montpellier, France) and cross-reactivity towards Japanese Encephalitis virus (JEV) was also carried out using the JEV-double antigen sandwich (DAS) ELISA. Oropharyngeal swabs were subjected to one-step RT-PCR to detect WNV RNA, in which positive reactions were subsequently sequenced. WNV seropositive rate of 18.71% (29/155) at 95% CI (0.131 to 0.260) and molecular prevalence of 15.2% (16/105) at 95% CI (0.092 to 0.239) were demonstrated in migratory and resident wild birds found in West Coast Malaysia. Phylogenetic analyses of the 16 WNV isolates found in this study revealed that the local strains have 99% similarity to the strains from South Africa and were clustered under lineage 2. Evidence of WNV infection in resident and migratory birds were demonstrated in this study. As a summary, intervention between migratory birds, resident birds and mosquitoes might cause the introduction and maintenance of WNV in Malaysia, however the assumption could be further proven by studying the infection dynamics in the mosquitoes present in the studied areas.",0.8570433259010315,True
Bifid nose,32043524,"BACKGROUND:Intellectual disability (ID) affects 1-3% of the Western population and is heterogeneous in origin. Mutations in X-linked genes represent 5-10% of ID in males. Fragile X syndrome, due to the silencing of the FMR1 gene, is the most common form of ID, with a prevalence of around 1:5000 males. Females are usually non- or mildly affected carriers, and in a few rare cases, the only gender affected. Array comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) and next-generation sequencing (NGS) have dramatically changed the nature of human genome analysis leading to the identification of new X-linked intellectual disability syndromes and disease-causing genes. SOURCES OF DATA:Original papers, reviews, guidelines and experiences of the diagnostic laboratories. AREAS OF AGREEMENT:Family history and clinical examination still are essential to choose the appropriate diagnostic tests, including, a disease-specific genetic test, aCGH or FMR1 molecular analysis. If negative, NGS approaches like well-defined gene panels, whole exome, or even whole genome sequencing, are increasingly being used, improving diagnostics and leading to the identification of novel disease mechanisms. AREAS OF CONTROVERSY:The main challenge in the era of NGS is filtering and interpretation of the data generated by the analysis of a single individual. In X-linked cases, assessing pathogenicity is particularly challenging, even more when the variant is found to be inherited from a healthy carrier mother or when a heterozygous X-linked mutation is found in an impaired female. GROWING POINTS:At present, variant interpretation remains a challenging task, especially in X-linked disorders. We review the main difficulties and propose a comprehensive overview that might aid in variant interpretation. Establishing a genetic diagnosis facilitates counseling and allows better delineation of clinical phenotypes. AREAS TIMELY FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH:To improve variant interpretation, there is need to refine in silico predictions with specific criteria for each gene, and to develop cost-effective functional tools, which can be easily transferred to diagnostics.",0.8566756248474121,True
Peripheral T-cell lymphoma,33959521,"<h4>Background</h4>Childhood alopecia areata (AA) is a common cause of dermatologic consultation; however, data is scarce in the present set-up.<h4>Objectives</h4>To evaluate the clinico-epidemiological profile of childhood AA along with dermoscopic correlation.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted a cross-sectional study including 50 new cases of childhood AA for 1 year. Dermoscopy was performed in each child and findings recorded.<h4>Results</h4>Childhood AA was more common in girls (M: F 1:1.4), mean age being 11.1 ± 3.7 years. Scalp was commonest site of involvement in 86% cases, while 32 (64%) children had mild disease (<25% involvement). Localized circumscribed patch was the commonest presentation in 37 (74%) children, while sisaipho was the least (2%). A positive family history of AA was noted in 5 (10%) children. Twenty-four children (48%) provided a history of atopic disorders, while 30% had a positive family history of atopy. Stress was the commonest precipitating factor in 13 (26%) subjects. Nail involvement was observed in 19 (38%) children (pitting >thinning), while systemic associations like vitiligo and thyroid dysfunction were present in 26% and 24% cases, respectively. Dermoscopy revealed yellow-dots to be the commonest finding in 44 (88%) cases, followed by short vellus hair and black dots in 76% and 28% children, respectively, while exclamation-mark hair was rare.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Female gender, younger age, nail involvement, and presence of concomitant atopy, vitiligo, and thyroid dysfunction were associated with severe disease, but not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Regression model failed to detect any risk factors for severe AA. Dermoscopy is an important non-invasive tool for evaluating childhood AA.",0.8566392064094543,True
Atelosteogenesis type 1,8651292,"Mutations in the COL4A5 gene, located at Xq22, cause Alport syndrome (AS), a nephritis characterized by progressive deterioration of the glomerular basement membrane and usually associated with progressive hearing loss. We have identified a novel mutation, L1649R, present in 9 of 121 independently ascertained families. Affected males shared the same haplotype of eight polymorphic markers tightly linked to COL4A5, indicating common ancestry. Genealogical studies place the birth of this ancestor >200 years ago. The L1649R mutation is a relatively common cause of Alport syndrome in the western United States, in part because of the rapid growth and migratory expansion of mid-nineteenth-century pioneer populations carrying the gene. L1649R affects a highly conserved residue in the NC1 domain, which is involved in key inter- and intramolecular interactions, but results in a relatively mild disease phenotype. Renal failure in an L1649R male typically occurs in the 4th or 5th decade and precedes the onset of significant hearing loss by approximately 10 years.",0.8551366925239563,True
Floating-Harbor syndrome,17083718,"<h4>Background</h4>Target organ damage (mainly cardiac and renal damage) is easy to evaluate in outpatient clinics and offers valuable information about patient's cardiovascular risk. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, using simple methods, the prevalence of cardiac and renal damage and its relationship to the presence of established cardiovascular disease (CVD), in patients with hypertension (HT) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).<h4>Methods</h4>The RICARHD study is a multicentre, cross-sectional study made by 293 investigators in Nephrology and Internal Medicine Spanish outpatient clinics, and included patients aged 55 years or more with HT and type 2 DM with more than six months of diagnosis. Demographic, clinical and biochemical data, and CVD were collected from the clinical records. Cardiac damage was defined by the presence of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy (ECG-LVH), and renal damage by a calculated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, and/or the presence of an albumin/creatinine ratio > or = 30 mg/g; or an urinary albumin excretion (UAE) > or = 30 mg/24 hours.<h4>Results</h4>2339 patients (mean age 68.9 years, 48.2% females, 51.3% with established CVD) were included. ECG-LVH was present in 22.9% of the sample, GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 in 45.1%, and abnormal UAE in 58.7%. Compared with the reference patients (those without neither cardiac nor renal damage), patients with ECG-LVH alone (OR 2.20, [95%CI 1.43-3.38]), or kidney damage alone (OR 1.41, [1.13-1.75]) showed an increased prevalence of CVD. The presence of both ECG-LVH and renal damage was associated with the higher prevalence (OR 3.12, [2.33-4.19]). After stratifying by gender, this relationship was present for both, men and women.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In patients with HT and type 2 DM, ECG-LVH or renal damage, evaluated using simple methods, are associated with an increased prevalence of established CVD. The simultaneous presence of both cardiac and renal damage was associated to the higher prevalence of CVD, affording complementary information. A systematic assessment of cardiac and renal damage complements the risk assessment of these patients with HT and type 2 DM.",0.8550135493278503,True
Pallister-Hall syndrome,33995794,"Congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF) is a rare autosomal recessive disease derived from biliary dysgenesis secondary to ductal plate malformation; it often coexists with Caroli's disease, von Meyenburg complexes, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD). Although CHF was first named and described in detail by Kerr et al. in 1961. Its pathogenesis still remains unclear. The exact incidence and prevalence are not known, and only a few hundred patients with CHF have been reported in the literature to date. However, with the development of noninvasive diagnostic techniques such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), CHF may now be more frequently detected. Anatomopathological examination of liver biopsy is the gold standard in diagnosis of CHF. Patients with CHF exhibit variable clinical presentations, ranging from no symptoms to severe symptoms such as acute hepatic decompensation and even cirrhosis. The most common presentations in these patients are splenomegaly, esophageal varices, and gastrointestinal bleeding due to portal hypertension. In addition, in younger children, CHF often is accompanied by renal cysts or increased renal echogenicity. Great variability exists among the signs and symptoms of the disease from early childhood to the 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> decade of life, and in most patients the disorder is diagnosed during adolescence or young adulthood. Here, we present two cases of congenital hepatic fibrosis in 2-years-old girl and 12-year-old male who had been referred for evaluation of an abdominal distension with persistent hyper-transaminasemia and cholestasis, the diagnostic was made according to the results of medical imaging (CT or MRI), a liver biopsy, and genetic testing.",0.8530874848365784,True

Van Buchem disease type 2,32221727,"<h4>Purpose of review</h4>The aim was to review evidence about diabetes secondary to hereditary pancreatitis, seeking novel diagnostic and treatment features.<h4>Recent findings</h4>Hereditary pancreatitis (HP) is an autosomal dominant condition, characterized by recurrent episodes of acute pancreatitis, progression to fibrosis, and chronic pancreatitis. Clinical presentation includes diabetes of the exocrine pancreas (DEP). HP prevalence ranges from 0.3 to 0.57 per 100,000 people, with up to 80% of these develop DEP. This condition often requires specific interventions: with regard to metabolic control, metformin is the first choice for those with mild DEP, and for those in advanced disease, insulin is considered the first-line therapy. Insulin analogues and insulin pump therapy are preferred due to the brittle glycemic pattern and risk of hypoglycemia. In case of exocrine insufficiency, pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy is recommended. Pancreatic polypeptide administration is a promising novel treatment feature. DEP due to HP appears to be a misdiagnosed condition. The requirement of specific management demonstrates the importance of this matter; therefore, appropriate recognition and classification are important.",0.8521824479103088,True
Pulmonary artery coming from the aorta,31124294,"<h4>Background</h4>Several studies have shown a high rate of consanguinity and endogamy in North African populations.

Publication bias was assessed using funnel plots and the Duval and Tweedie trim and fill method.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 922 identified articles, 12 were found to meet the inclusion criteria. Most of them presented moderate or low risk of bias. A total of 397 patients were analyzed. The mean age was 62.34 years and 248 were women (62.5%). The mean follow-up was 79.3 months. The most frequent treatment was surgical removal with a cold scalpel or laser (339 patients). A total of 232 subjects presented lesion recurrence. The combination of proportions global effect meta-analysis yielded a recurrence rate of 67.2% (95% CI: 48.3-81.8), with the absence of publication bias.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There is not enough scientific evidence to conclude that any treatment strategy is able to reduce the recurrence in PVL.",0.8515186905860901,True
Infantile free sialic acid storage disease,33348196,"<h4>Objectives</h4>In this international study, we aimed to investigate the opinions of physicians dealing with patients with functional seizures (FS) worldwide on working restrictions and disability benefits eligibility.<h4>Methods</h4>International online survey of neurologists/mental health professionals from Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Italy, France, Iran, Iraq, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Georgia, and Russia.<h4>Results</h4>Six hundred and twenty-seven physicians from 12 countries participated in the study. Working as a neurologist was a predictor to think that patients with FS should not be counseled to avoid performing all jobs or professions as long as they have active disease (OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.30 to 0.68; p < 0.001). Having managed more than 200 patients was associated with the opinion that patients should not be counseled to avoid performing any type of work (OR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.02 to 4.59; p = 0.043). Working as a psychiatrist/psychologist was associated with the idea that patients with FS should be qualified for disability benefits (OR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.21-3.21; p = 0.006), and receive these benefits lifelong (OR: 0.43; 95% CI: 0.22-0.84; p = 0.014).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Neurologists and mental health professionals have different attitudes and opinions toward working restrictions and disability benefits for patients with FS. Further studies should investigate the reasons for these differences, and propose solutions to avoid discrimination and unequal access to employment and disability benefits.",0.8511365652084351,True
"Male pseudohermaphroditism intellectual disability syndrome, Verloes type",34071336,"We have previously shown that 67% of patients with newly diagnosed coeliac disease (CD) presenting to gastroenterologists have evidence of neurological dysfunction. This manifested with headache and loss of co-ordination. Furthermore 60% of these patients had abnormal brain imaging. In this follow-up study, we re-examined and re-scanned 30 patients from the original cohort of 100, seven years later. There was significant reduction in the prevalence of headaches (47% to 20%) but an increase in the prevalence of incoordination (27% to 47%). Although those patients with coordination problems at baseline reported improvement on the gluten free diet (GFD), there were 7 patients reporting incoordination not present at baseline. All 7 patients had positive serology for one or more gluten-sensitivity related antibodies at follow-up. In total, 50% of the whole follow-up cohort were positive for one or more gluten-related antibodies. A comparison between the baseline and follow-up brain imaging showed a greater rate of cerebellar grey matter atrophy in the antibody positive group compared to the antibody negative group. Patients with CD who do not adhere to a strict GFD and are serological positive are at risk of developing ataxia, and have a significantly higher rate of cerebellar atrophy when compared to patients with negative serology. This highlights the importance of regular review and close monitoring.",0.8506700396537781,True
Glycogen storage disease type 3,34129132,"<h4>Background</h4>The majority of active tuberculosis (TB) cases develop from latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Since the risk of TB in hemodialysis (HD) patients is particularly high, interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) for LTBI screening in HD patients is considered important. However, the prevalence and characteristics of LTBI in Japanese HD patients remain obscure.<h4>Methods</h4>We performed an observational cross-sectional study of LTBI using IGRA QFT-3G tests in 118 HD outpatients enrolled at 3 hospitals of varying location and function.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 118 patients, 96 were QFT negative, 7 were QFT indeterminate, 14 were QFT positive, and 1 was QFT judgment impossible. No patient had active TB. Confirmed (QFT positive) and possible (QFT positive + indeterminate) LTBI patients totaled 14 (11.9%) and 21 (17.8%), respectively. The LTBI possible group was significantly older and had a significantly higher rate of nephrosclerosis versus the QFT-negative group. The indeterminate group had a significantly longer HD period. The QFT results were not remarkably affected by other clinical data, including hospital characteristics. The possible LTBI rate increased age-dependently, with higher values from 60 years of age.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prevalence of LTBI is high in Japanese HD patients, especially from the age of 60 years. Older age was a significant risk factor for LTBI, with prediction difficult using other clinical data. Extended HD may mask IGRA results. Therefore, aggressive screening for LTBI is advised in all HD patients regardless of hospital region or type, especially in patients over 60 years of age or newly commencing HD.",0.8500419855117798,True
Familial chylomicronemia syndrome,33733022,"The field of Cardio-oncology is rapidly growing with significant advances in research leading to better understanding of the underlying pathogenesis with implications in the diagnosis and management of cancer-related cardiomyopathy. Parallel to advancement in cardio-oncology is an increased awareness of the incidence of congestive heart failure and cardiomyopathy associated with malignancy. While specific cardiotoxic profiles exist for certain chemotherapeutic agents, there is increasing evidence of unexpected cardiotoxic side effects of some therapeutic modalities, combination chemo- and radiotherapy with large analyses identifying a strong association between malignancy and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy, also known as ""broken-heart"" syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy, is characterized by transient and reversible, regional or global, myocardial dysfunction without inciting ischemic perfusion defect from obstructive coronary artery disease. While direct causative pathophysiologic mechanisms continue to be investigated, much of the postulated pathways center on the high emotional and physical burdens of cancer and the related emotional stress associated with the diagnosis of cancer as well as the corporal effects of anti-neoplastic therapies, radiation, and oncologic surgery. In this manuscript we review the most current data in this rapidly emerging field highlighting the epidemiology, the postulated pathogenetic mechanisms as well as the current guidelines by major societies addressing malignancy -associated heart failure and cardiomyopathy, a rather complex disease entity with high morbidity and mortality.",0.8462299108505249,True
Dissociative seizures,33579342,"<h4>Background</h4>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) represents a group of connective tissue disorders characterized by the fragility of the soft connective tissues resulting in widespread skin, ligament, joint, blood vessel and internal organ involvement. The clinical spectrum is highly variable in terms of clinical features, complications, severity, biochemical characteristics and genes mutations. The kyphoscoliotic type EDS (EDS VIA) is a rare variant of the disease, with an incidence of 1:100.000 live births. EDS VIA presents at birth as severe muscular hypotonia, early onset of progressive kyphoscoliosis, marked hyperelasticity and fragility of the skin with abnormal scarring, severe joint hypermobility, luxations and osteopenia without a tendency to fractures. This condition is due to a mutation in the PLOD1 gene, and less commonly in FKBP14 gene, which results in the erroneous development of collagen molecules with consequent mechanical instability of the affected tissue.<h4>Case presentation</h4>A female newborn, found to be floppy at birth, presented a remarkable physical examination for joint hypermobility, muscle weakness, hyperelastic skin, a slight curve of the spine, the absence of the inferior labial and lingual frenulum. Due to severe hypotonia, neuromuscular disorders such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), genetic diseases such as Prader Willi syndrome (PWS), myopathies and connective tissue disorders were considered in the differential diagnosis. Targeted gene sequencing were performed for SMN1, PLOD1, FKBP14, COL6A1, COL6A2, COL6A3. The urinary lysyl and hydroxy-lysyl pyridinoline ratio was diagnostic before discovering the homozygous duplication in the PLOD1 gene, which confirmed kyphoscoliotic EDS diagnosis.<h4>Conclusion</h4>In front of a floppy infant, a large variety of disorders should be considered, including some connective diseases. The presence at the birth of kyphoscoliosis, associated with joint hypermobility and the absence of the lingual and lower lip frenulum, should suggest an EDS.",0.8447838425636292,True
"Deafness, epiphyseal dysplasia, short stature",34128192,"<h4>Objective</h4>This study aimed to examine the application of the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) to the assessment of competency among child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) residents and to analyze the feedback from the residents and the examiners.<h4>Methods</h4>The OSCE was administered to 53 CAP residents based on three seniority levels over a 14-year period. The results of 147 OSCEs applied to residents and the feedback received were evaluated. OSCE scores were calculated based on the scores given by the examiners and standardized patients (SPs).<h4>Results</h4>Examiners' communication skills scores were significantly higher than examiners' task performance scores but were not significantly different than the SPs' scores. Intraclass correlation coefficients indicated that examiners and SPs were very consistent in their assessments among themselves. The scores given by the examiners and the SPs were not different between genders except for female residents' communication skills scores given by SPs in the OSCE-senior. With regard to the feedback on the OSCE, it was determined that examiners gave significantly higher scores than residents on every item except for ""neutrality of the examiners.""<h4>Conclusions</h4>A standard OSCE including different station types was structured to assess the progressive clinical skills of residents over the years. Using the OSCE contributed to CAP residency training far beyond assessment, creating a useful educational experience for both the trainers and the residents. Despite the challenge experienced related to SPs, the OSCE was found to be useful in improving training programs.",0.8444485068321228,True

We screened and extracted papers that reported sleep disorder prevalence data for five or more individuals within a genetic syndrome, and applied quality criteria to produce a quality-effects prevalence model of six types of sleep disorder across nineteen syndromes. Relative risk estimates were calculated for the prevalence of each sleep disorder in each syndrome.<h4>Results</h4>Two hundred and seventy three papers were identified, generating 463 prevalence estimates for Angelman, CHARGE, Cornelia de Lange, Down, fragile X, Prader-Willi, Rett, Smith-Magenis and Williams syndromes, mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS disorders), neurofibromatosis and tuberous sclerosis complex. Prevalence estimates were higher in genetic syndromes than published equivalents for typically developing individuals, with few exceptions. Between-syndrome differences for some disorders were evident; sleep-disordered breathing was most prevalent in MPS disorders (72-77%), while excessive daytime sleepiness was highest in Smith-Magenis syndrome (60%). Conversely, insomnia, which was reported at a higher rate than TD estimates in all syndromes except fragile X, was not associated with specific genetic risk. This suggests insomnia could emerge because of the individual's environment or associated developmental delay, rather than any specific genetic syndromes.<h4>Limitations</h4>Due to the broad scope of the meta-analysis, only syndromes previously identified as reporting preliminary sleep research were included. Other syndromes may also experience elevated prevalence rates of specific types of sleep disorder. Only English language papers were included.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Differing prevalence rates between types of sleep disorder suggest differing causal mechanisms, such as cranio-facial morphology in Down and Prader-Willi syndromes and the build-up of mucopolysaccharides in MPS disorders.

The primary objective was to determine an accurate prevalence of spontaneous SAT lesions in a large series of patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome at diagnosis and during follow-up. Secondary objectives were to study their neurological consequences (transient ischemic attack or stroke) and the possible relationships with sex, genotype, ascertainment status.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective review of a monocentric cohort of patients with molecularly proven vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome followed in a tertiary referral center from 2000 to 2017.<h4>Results</h4>One hundred forty-four patients were analyzed, 56.9% (n=82) had SAT lesions: 64.6% females, 74.4% index-case patients. Most lesions were identified in early arterial assessment (48% at first work-up, mean age of 35.7±13.0 years).

We report seven patients from three families presenting heterozygous missense variants in PTPN11 probably responsible for a disease phenotype distinct from the classical Noonan syndrome. The clinical presentation and common features of these seven cases overlap with the SHORT syndrome. The latter is the consequence of PI3K/AKT signaling deregulation with the predominant disease-causing gene being PIK3R1. Our data suggest that the phenotypic spectrum associated with pathogenic variants of PTPN11 could be wider than previously described, and this could be due to the dual activity of SHP2 (ie, PTPN11 gene product) on the RAS/MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling.",0.8418391346931458,True

Methods and Results GARFIELD - AF is a prospective registry of patients from 35 countries, including patients from Asia (China, India, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand). Consecutive patients enrolled (2013-2016) were classified with no, mild, or moderate-to-severe CKD , based on the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines. Data on CKD status and outcomes were available for 33 024 of 34 854 patients (including 9491 patients from Asia); 10.9% (n=3613) had moderate-to-severe CKD , 16.9% (n=5595) mild CKD , and 72.1% (n=23 816) no CKD . The use of oral anticoagulants was influenced by stroke risk (ie, post hoc assessment of CHA <sub>2</sub> DS <sub>2</sub>- VAS c score), but not by CKD stage. The quality of anticoagulant control with vitamin K antagonists did not differ with CKD stage. After adjusting for baseline characteristics and antithrombotic use, both mild and moderate-to-severe CKD were independent risk factors for all-cause mortality. Moderate-to-severe CKD was independently associated with a higher risk of stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, new-onset acute coronary syndrome, and new or worsening heart failure. The impact of moderate-to-severe CKD on mortality was significantly greater in patients from Asia than the rest of the world ( P=0.001). Conclusions In GARFIELD - AF , moderate-to-severe CKD was independently associated with stroke/systemic embolism, major bleeding, and mortality. The effect of moderate-to-severe CKD on mortality was even greater in patients from Asia than the rest of the world. Clinical Trial Registration URL : http://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

Brachydactyly type A5,33948753,"Maternal hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (HDP) have been associated with neuropsychiatric problems in offspring. We aim to investigate the associations between specific types of maternal HDP and offspring neurodevelopmental disorders and further examine whether the timing of onset and severity of HDP would affect these associations. The study population consisted of 4,489,044 live-born singletons in Denmark during 1978-2012 and Sweden during 1987-2010. Maternal HDP was categorized into chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, and pre-eclampsia; pre-eclampsia was further stratified according to timing (early-onset, late-onset), or severity (moderate, severe) of the disease. Neurodevelopmental disorders, including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and intellectual disability (ID), were defined by ICD-coded register diagnosis. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) while adjusting for potential confounders, and sibling analyses assessed the influence of unmeasured shared familial factors. Maternal HDP was associated with increased risks of ADHD (HR, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.28), ASD (1.29 [1.24-1.34]), and ID (1.58 [1.50-1.66]) in offspring, respectively, which was mostly driven by pre-eclampsia.

Selenium poisoning,33975404,"Middle ear barotrauma (MEB) is a common complication of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) therapy. It has been reported in more than 40% of HBO2 treatments and can interrupt the sequence of HBO2. MEB may lead to pain, tympanic membrane rupture, and even hearing loss. The aim of this study was to determine if pretreatment with intranasal fluticasone and oxymetazoline affected the incidence of MEB. We conducted a retrospective chart review of subjects undergoing HBO2 at our institution between February 1, 2014, and May 31, 2019. Subjects in the fluticasone/oxymetazoline (FOT) treatment group used intranasal fluticasone 50 mcg two times per day and oxymetazoline 0.05% one spray two times per day beginning 48 hours prior to initial HBO2. Oxymetazoline was discontinued after four days. Fluticasone was continued for the duration of HBO2 therapy. A total of 154 unique subjects underwent 5,683 HBO2 treatments: 39 unique subjects in the FOT group underwent 1,501 HBO2; 115 unique subjects in the nFOT (no oxymetazoline or fluticasone treatment) group underwent 4,182 HBO2 treatments. The incidence of MEB was 15.4% in the FOT group and 16.2% in the nFOT group. This was not a statistically significant difference (OR = 0.77; p = 0.636). Treatment pressure, age over 65 years, male sex, and BMI were not associated with a difference in MEB incidence. In summary, pretreatment with intranasal oxymetazoline and fluticasone in patients undergoing HBO2 did not significantly reduce MEB. More investigation with larger numbers of participants and prospective studies could further clarify this issue.",0.833075761795044,True

The study included 263 samples from individuals from the Kateté, Djujeko and Oodjã villages. Plasma samples were tested for the presence of anti-HTLV-1/2 antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Seropositive samples were confirmed using real-time PCR, nested PCR and sequencing.<h4>Results</h4>The serological and molecular results confirmed the sole presence of HTLV-2 in 77 (29%) samples, with a prevalence of 38% among women and 18% among men. In these communities, it was found that the prevalence of HTLV-2 infection increased with age. Nucleotide sequences (642 bp, 5'LTR) from eight samples were subjected to phylogenetic analysis by the neighbor-joining method to determine the viral subtype, which confirmed the presence of HTLV-2c.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The results of the present study establish the presence of HTLV-2 infection in three new villages of the Xikrin tribe and confirm the high endemicity of the infection in the Kayapo indigenous group of the Brazilian Amazon.",0.8315500020980835,True

Kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,31175630,"Oculomotor abnormalities are common in the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs). In studies of SCAs 1, 2, 3, and 6, eye movement abnormalities correlate with disease severity. Oculomotor abnormalities may be the sole motor manifestation of early and/or premanifest disease; however, not all ataxia rating scales include oculomotor assessment. We sought to identify the prevalence and characteristics of oculomotor abnormalities at first presentation in a large SCA cohort, including those in earlier stages of disease. We performed a retrospective assessment of initial clinical examinations of SCA patients followed in the Massachusetts General Hospital Ataxia Unit and assessed with the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS). One hundred thirty-four SCA patients were assessed: 17 SCA1, 13 SCA2, 55 SCA3, 2 SCA5, 22 SCA6, 11 SCA7, 9 SCA8, and 5 SCA17, mainly in the early stages of disease (67.2% stage 0-1). Oculomotor abnormalities were present on initial assessment in 94.8%, including 7/9 stage 0 and 77/81 stage 1 patients. Stage 0/1 patients had frequent saccadic intrusions, nystagmus, and hypo/hypermetric saccades. Saccadic slowing was present even in early stage SCA7 and SCA2, eventually leading to ophthalmoplegia. The burden of oculomotor abnormalities correlated with disease stage, duration, and severity, remaining highly significant even when controlling for age. The ubiquitous presence of oculomotor abnormalities in the SCAs, particularly early in the course, underscores the importance of oculomotor assessment in ataxia rating scales such as BARS.

Gomez Lopez Hernandez syndrome,30468117,"Wilson's disease or hepatolenticular degeneration Abstract. Wilson's disease, or hepatolenticular degeneration, is a rare inherited disorder of copper metabolism. The most common clinical presentations are liver disease and / or neuro-psychiatric manifestations. Pathophysiologically, Wilson's disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which lead to defective biliary excretion of copper and subsequent accumulation of copper in the liver and in other organs. Its prevalence is approximately 1:30 000, however its penetrance, clinical presentation and disease severity vary widely, ranging from asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes to cirrhosis or acute liver failure with or without neuro-psychiatric symptoms. For this reason, Wilson's disease should be suspected and ruled out in cases of indeterminate liver disease or neuropsychiatric disturbances. The diagnostic algorithms are complex and involve clinical tests, ophthalmologic examination (Kayser-Fleischer rings in split-lamp examination), blood and urine tests, genetic testing, imaging and histology. In compensated liver disease, treatment of Wilson's disease by copper depletion (chelators, zinc) is usually effective. In case of liver failure liver transplantation may be needed, which corrects the underlying error of copper metabolism. New drugs with improved efficacy and tolerability are in clinical development.",0.828540027141571,True
Dandy-Walker malformation with sagittal craniosynostosis and hydrocephalus,33414558,"Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a heritable connective tissue disorder (HCTD) caused by pathogenic variants in FBN1 that frequently occur de novo. Although individuals with somatogonadal mosaicisms have been reported with respect to MFS and other HCTD, the overall frequency of parental mosaicism in this pathology is unknown. In an attempt to estimate this frequency, we reviewed all the 333 patients with a disease-causing variant in FBN1. We then used direct sequencing, combined with High Resolution Melting Analysis, to detect mosaicism in their parents, complemented by NGS when a mosaicism was objectivized. We found that (1) the number of apparently de novo events is much higher than the classically admitted number (around 50% of patients and not 25% as expected for FBN1) and (2) around 5% of the FBN1 disease-causing variants were not actually de novo as anticipated, but inherited in a context of somatogonadal mosaicisms revealed in parents from three families. High Resolution Melting Analysis and NGS were more efficient at detecting and evaluating the level of mosaicism compared to direct Sanger sequencing. We also investigated individuals with a causal variant in another gene identified through our ""aortic diseases genes"" NGS panel and report, for the first time, on an individual with a somatogonadal mosaicism in COL5A1.

From 10,278 consecutive patients with AMI, we included 183 patients who had cardiac rupture after AMI, and examined the incidence of in-hospital deaths during a median follow-up of 26 days. Patients were stratified into three groups according to the AMI-to-cardiac rupture time, namely the > 24-h group (n = 111), 24-48-h group (n = 20), and < 48-h group (n = 52). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and the confidence interval (CI) for in-hospital mortality. Around 87 (48%) patients experienced in-hospital death and 126 (67%) underwent a cardiac surgery. Multivariable Cox regression analysis revealed a non-linear association across the three groups for mortality (HR [CI]; < 24 h: 1.0, reference; 24-48 h: 0.73 [0.27-1.86]; > 48 h: 2.25 [1.22-4.15]) after adjustments for age, sex, Killip classification, percutaneous coronary intervention, blood pressure, creatinine, peak creatine kinase myocardial band fraction, left ventricular ejection fraction, and type of rupture. Cardiac surgery was independently associated with a reduction in the HR of mortality (HR [CI]: 0.27 [0.12-0.61]) and attenuated the association between the three AMI-to-cardiac rupture time categories and mortality (statistically non-significant) in the Cox model. These data suggest that the AMI-to-cardiac rupture time contributes significantly to the risk of in-hospital mortality; however, rapid diagnosis and prompt surgical interventions are crucial for improving outcomes in patients with cardiac rupture after AMI.",0.8245159387588501,True
Joubert syndrome with ocular anomalies,33930902,"Coagulation factor X (F10) amplifies the clotting reaction in the middle of the coagulation cascade, and thus F10 deficiency leads to a bleeding tendency. Isolated acquired F10 deficiency is widely recognized in patients with immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis or plasma cell dyscrasias. However, its occurrence as an autoimmune disorder is extremely rare. The Japanese Collaborative Research Group has been conducting a nationwide survey on autoimmune coagulation factor deficiencies (AiCFDs) starting in the last decade; we recently identified three patients with autoimmune F10 deficiency (AiF10D). Furthermore, an extensive literature search was performed, confirming 26 AiF10D and 28 possible cases. Our study revealed that AiF10D patients were younger than patients with other AiCFDs; AiF10D patients included children and were predominantly male. AiF10D was confirmed as a severe type of bleeding diathesis, although its mortality rate was not high. As AiF10D patients showed only low F10 inhibitor titers, they were considered to have nonneutralizing anti-F10 autoantibodies rather than their neutralizing counterparts. Accordingly, immunological anti-F10 antibody detection is highly recommended. Hemostatic and immunosuppressive therapies may help arrest bleeding and eliminate anti-F10 antibodies, leading to a high recovery rate.

Fatty acid hydroxylase-associated neurodegeneration,25112391,"Adenylosuccinate lyase ADSL) deficiency is a defect of purine metabolism affecting purinosome assembly and reducing metabolite fluxes through purine de novo synthesis and purine nucleotide recycling pathways. Biochemically this defect manifests by the presence in the biologic fluids of two dephosphorylated substrates of ADSL enzyme: succinylaminoimidazole carboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (S-Ado). More than 80 individuals with ADSL deficiency have been identified, but incidence of the disease remains unknown. The disorder shows a wide spectrum of symptoms from slowly to rapidly progressing forms. The fatal neonatal form has onset from birth and presents with fatal neonatal encephalopathy with a lack of spontaneous movement, respiratory failure, and intractable seizures resulting in early death within the first weeks of life. Patients with type I (severe form) present with a purely neurologic clinical picture characterized by severe psychomotor retardation, microcephaly, early onset of seizures, and autistic features. A more slowly progressing form has also been described (type II, moderate or mild form), as having later onset, usually within the first years of life, slight to moderate psychomotor retardation and transient contact disturbances. Diagnosis is facilitated by demonstration of SAICAr and S-Ado in extracellular fluids such as plasma, cerebrospinal fluid and/or followed by genomic and/or cDNA sequencing and characterization of mutant proteins. Over 50 ADSL mutations have been identified and their effects on protein biogenesis, structural stability and activity as well as on purinosome assembly were characterized. To date there is no specific and effective therapy for ADSL deficiency.",0.8229519128799438,True
Cataract and congenital ichthyosis,33224906,"Ever since SARS-CoV-2 began infecting people by the end of 2019, of whom some developed severe pneumonia (about 5%), which could be fatal (case fatality ~3.5%), the extent and speed of the COVID-19 outbreak has been phenomenal.

Chinese pediatricians would like to share their experience on how these patients were managed in China and the key recommendations that had guided them in meeting the evolving challenges. A group of experts were summoned by the Chinese Pediatric Society and Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Pediatrics to extract informative data from a survey on confirmed COVID-19 pediatric patients in China. Consensus on diagnosis, management, and prevention of pediatric COVID-19 were drawn up based on the analysis of such data plus insights gained from the past SARS and MERS coronavirus outbreaks.

Schrander-Stumpel Theunissen Hulsmans syndrome,33239597,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) was the fourth disorder added to the national Swedish neonatal screening program in 1986, and approximately 115,000 newborns are screened annually. Dried blood spot (DBS) screening with measurement of 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) is also offered to older children moving to Sweden from countries lacking a national DBS screening program. Here, we report an update on the CAH screening from January 2011 until December 2019. <i>Results</i>: During the study period, 1,030,409 newborns and 34,713 older children were screened. In total, 87 newborns were verified to have CAH, which gives an overall positive predictive value (PPV) of 11% and 21% for term infants. Including the five missed CAH cases identified during this period, this gives an incidence of 1:11,200 of CAH in Sweden. Among the older children, 12 of 14 recalled cases were found to be true positive for CAH. All patients were genotyped as part of the clinical follow-up and 70% of the newborns had salt wasting (SW) CAH and 92% had classic CAH (i.e., SW and simple virilizing (SV) CAH). In the group of 12 older children, none had SW CAH and two had SV CAH. <i>Conclusion</i>: The incidence of classic CAH is relatively high in Sweden. Early genetic confirmation with <i>CYP21A2</i> genotyping has been a valuable complement to the analysis of 17OHP to predict disease severity, make treatment decisions and for the follow-up and evaluation of the screening program.",0.8214764595031738,True
Chromosome 17p13.1 deletion syndrome,32973676,"Autoimmune thyroid disease (ATD) is the most frequent cause of acquired thyroid dysfunction, most commonly presenting either as Hashimoto's thyroiditis or Graves' Disease. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is characterized by the presence of thyroid-specific autoantibodies, more commonly anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies in the serum and the typical inhomogeneous echostructure of the thyroid on a thyroid ultrasound examination. Hashimoto's thyroiditis can for a long time be accompanied by normal thyroid function and hypothyroidism can only progressively be established. Graves' disease is much less frequent in childhood and adolescence and presents with overt hyperthyroidism. After the onset of puberty, ATD affects females with a higher incidence than males, while during the prepubertal period there is not such a clear preponderance of affected females. ATD can occur either isolated or in the context of other autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 Diabetes mellitus (T1D), celiac disease, alopecia areata, vitiligo, etc. Especially at the pediatric age, a higher incidence of ATD is also observed in the context of specific genetic syndromes, such as trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), Klinefelter syndrome, Turner syndrome, or 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Nevertheless, although thyroid dysfunction may also be observed in other genetic syndromes, such as Prader-Willi or Williams syndrome, the thyroid dysfunction in these syndromes is not the result of thyroid autoimmunity. Interestingly, there is emerging evidence supporting a possible link between autoimmunity and RASopathies. In this review article the incidence, as well as the clinical manifestation and accompanied pathologies of ATD in specific genetic syndromes will be presented and regular follow-up for the early identification of the disorder will be proposed.",0.8212935924530029,True
Floating-Harbor syndrome,32758659,"<h4>Objectives</h4>To analyse the characteristics and predictors of death in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Spain.<h4>Methods</h4>A retrospective observational study was performed of the first consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 confirmed by real-time PCR assay in 127 Spanish centres until 17 March 2020. The follow-up censoring date was 17 April 2020. We collected demographic, clinical, laboratory, treatment and complications data. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with death.<h4>Results</h4>Of the 4035 patients, male subjects accounted for 2433 (61.0%) of 3987, the median age was 70 years and 2539 (73.8%) of 3439 had one or more comorbidity. The most common symptoms were a history of fever, cough, malaise and dyspnoea. During hospitalization, 1255 (31.5%) of 3979 patients developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, 736 (18.5%) of 3988 were admitted to intensive care units and 619 (15.5%) of 3992 underwent mechanical ventilation. Virus- or host-targeted medications included lopinavir/ritonavir (2820/4005, 70.4%), hydroxychloroquine (2618/3995, 65.5%), interferon beta (1153/3950, 29.2%), corticosteroids (1109/3965, 28.0%) and tocilizumab (373/3951, 9.4%). Overall, 1131 (28%) of 4035 patients died. Mortality increased with age (85.6% occurring in older than 65 years). Seventeen factors were independently associated with an increased hazard of death, the strongest among them including advanced age, liver cirrhosis, low age-adjusted oxygen saturation, higher concentrations of C-reactive protein and lower estimated glomerular filtration rate.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our findings provide comprehensive information about characteristics and complications of severe COVID-19, and may help clinicians identify patients at a higher risk of death.",0.8210384249687195,True
Simian B virus infection,29479880,"BACKGROUND:Lesch-Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is a congenital X-linked recessive neurogenetic disorder caused by mutations in the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) gene. The main clinical manifestation includes hyperuricemia, juvenile-onset gouty arthritis, and neurological developmental disorders. Studies have reported more than 400 HPRT gene mutation sites, but the incidence of LNS in the Chinese population is extremely low. METHODS:Here we report a 16-year-old male patient who suffered neurological dysfunction at an early age and gouty arthritis in his youth. RESULTS:No activity of the HPRT enzyme was detected in the erythrocytes. Furthermore, we found a mutation on exon 3 of the HPRT gene in the patient and his mother (exon 3: c.143G>A), which resulted in arginine to histidine (p.R48H) substitution in the encoded protein. The same mutation was reported in several European families, but was found for the first time in a Chinese family. CONCLUSIONS:Clinicians in China have poor experience in diagnosing LNS cases due to the low incidence in China. Therefore, LNS screening for infants or adolescents with hyperuricemia, gouty arthritis, and neurological dysfunction should be performed.",0.820310115814209,True

Cleft lip palate pituitary deficiency,32198913,"<h4>Background</h4>Cobalamin (cbl) C is a treatable rare hereditary disorder of cbl metabolism with autosomal recessive inheritance. It is the most common organic acidemia, manifested as methylmalonic academia combined with homocysteinemia. Early screening and diagnosis are important. The mutation spectrum of the MMACHC gene causing cblC varies among populations. The mutation spectrum in Chinese population is notably different from that in other populations.<h4>Methods</h4>A PCR followed by high-resolution melting curve analysis (PCR-HRM) method covering all coding exons of MMACHC gene was designed to verify 14 pathogenic MMACHC gene variants found in patients with cblC, including all common mutations in Chinese patients with cblC.<h4>Result</h4>By PCR-HRM analysis, 14 pathogenic variants of MMACHC showed distinctly different melting curves, which were consistent with Sanger sequencing. The homozygous type of the most common mutation c.609G > A (p.Trp203Ter) can also be analyzed by specially designed PCR-HRM.<h4>Conclusion</h4>The established PCR-HRM method for screening common pathogenic MMACHC variants in Chinese patients with cblC has the advantages of high accuracy, high throughput, low cost, and high speed.

"Coxa vara, congenital",28127864,"Constitutional ring chromosomes can be found for all human chromosomes and are very rare chromosomal abnormalities. A complete ring chromosome without loss of genetic material results from fusion of subtelomeric regions or telomere-telomere fusion. In cases of complete ring chromosome, an increased incidence of severe growth failure with no or only minor anomalies has been observed and attributed to ring syndrome. Ring syndrome is thought to be caused by ""dynamic mosaicism"" due to ring instability. We report a 6-year-old boy with de novo ring chromosome 4 and typical characteristics of the ring syndrome, namely, proportionate severe growth failure, microcephaly, and minor anomalies. Cytogenetic studies showed complete ring chromosome 4 with mitotic instability. Microarray gave normal results, thus excluding the loss of detectable genetic material. The literature of complete ring chromosome 4 is reviewed. Our case report supports the theory of ring syndrome. No studies about the effects and possible side effects of growth hormone therapy on patients with ring chromosomes have yet been published. We suggest that cytogenetic monitoring of the rate of secondary aberrations in patients with ring chromosome undergoing growth hormone therapy might be feasible. Since the diagnosis would have been missed by molecular karyotyping, our case report underlines the continuing role of classical cytogenetics for the evaluation of structural chromosomal abnormalities in patients with mental and/or physical anomalies.

Based on their sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents, FA cells have been assigned to 15 complementation groups, and the associated genes have been identified. Founder mutations have been found in different FA genes in several populations. The majority of Dutch FA patients belongs to complementation group FA-C. Here, we report 15 patients of Dutch ancestry and a large Canadian Manitoba Mennonite kindred carrying the FANCC c.67delG mutation. Genealogical investigation into the ancestors of the Dutch patients shows that these ancestors lived in four distinct areas in The Netherlands.

Subpulmonary stenosis,33511390,"The end-of-outbreak declaration is an important step in controlling infectious disease outbreaks. Objective estimation of the confidence level that an outbreak is over is important to reduce the risk of postdeclaration flare-ups. We developed a simulation-based model with which to quantify that confidence and tested it on simulated Ebola virus disease data. We found that these confidence estimates were most sensitive to the instantaneous reproduction number, the reporting rate, and the time between the symptom onset and death or recovery of the last detected case. For Ebola virus disease, our results suggested that the current World Health Organization criterion of 42 days since the recovery or death of the last detected case is too short and too sensitive to underreporting. Therefore, we suggest a shift to a preliminary end-of-outbreak declaration after 63 days from the symptom onset day of the last detected case. This preliminary declaration should still be followed by 90 days of enhanced surveillance to capture potential flare-ups of cases, after which the official end of the outbreak can be declared. This sequence corresponds to more than 95% confidence that an outbreak is over in most of the scenarios examined. Our framework is generic and therefore could be adapted to estimate end-of-outbreak confidence for other infectious diseases.",0.8131659626960754,True
Bifid nose,33757564,"<h4>Objective</h4>Intellectual Disability (ID) represents a neuropsychiatric disorder, which its etiopathogenesis remains insufficiently understood. Mutations in the Aristaless Related Homeobox gene (ARX) have been identified to cause syndromic and nonsyndromic (NS-ID). The most recurrent mutation of this gene is a duplication of 24pb, c.428-451dup. Epidemiological and genetic studies about ID in the Moroccan population remain very scarce, and none study is carried out on the ARX gene. This work aimed to study c.428-451dup (24 bp) mutation in the exon 2 of the ARX gene in 118 males' Moroccan patients with milder NS-ID to evaluate if the gene screening is a good tool for identifying NS-ID.<h4>Results</h4>Our mutational analysis did not show any dup(24pb) in our patients. This is because based on findings from previous studies that found ARX mutations in 70% of families with NS-ID, and in most cases, 1.5-6.1% of individuals with NS-ID have this duplication. Since 1/118 = 0.0084 (0.84%) is not much different from 1.5%, then it is reasonable that this could a sample size artifact. A complete screening of the entire ARX gene, including the five exons, should be fulfilled. Further investigations are required to confirm these results.",0.8119950294494629,True
Dandy-Walker malformation with sagittal craniosynostosis and hydrocephalus,29549458,"Gastrointestinal symptoms are among the most common complaints in patients with postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). In some cases, they dominate the clinical presentation and cause substantial disabilities, including significant weight loss and malnutrition, that require the use of invasive treatment to support caloric intake. Multiple cross-sectional studies have reported a high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in POTS patients with connective tissue diseases, such as Ehlers-Danlos, hypermobile type, and in patients with evidence of autonomic neuropathy. Previous studies that evaluated gastric motility in these patients reported a wide range of abnormalities, particularly delayed gastric emptying. The pathophysiology of gastrointestinal symptoms in POTS is likely multifactorial and probably depends on the co-morbid conditions. In patients with POTS and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, structural and functional abnormalities in the gastrointestinal connective tissue may play a significant role, whereas in neuropathic POTS, the gastrointestinal tract motility and gut hormonal secretion may be directly impaired due to localized autonomic denervation. In patients with normal gastrointestinal motility but persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, gastrointestinal functional disorders should be considered. We performed a systematic review of the literature related to POTS and gastrointestinal symptoms have proposed possible mechanisms and discussed diagnosis and treatment approaches for delayed gastric emptying, the most common gastrointestinal abnormality reported in patients with POTS.",0.8114875555038452,True

"Cataract, posterior polar, 4",33586465,"Background A higher risk of developing dementia is observed in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Results are inconsistent regarding the risk of dementia when patients with AF use different anticoagulants. We aimed to investigate the risk of dementia in patients with AF receiving non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) compared with those receiving warfarin. Methods and Results We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study of incident cases using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. We initially enlisted all incident cases of AF and then selected those treated with either NOACs or warfarin for at least 90 days between 2012 and 2016. First-ever diagnosis of dementia was the primary outcome. We performed propensity score matching to minimize the difference between each cohort. We used the Fine and Gray competing risk regression model to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) for dementia. We recruited 12 068 patients with AF (6034 patients in each cohort). The mean follow-up time was 3.27 and 3.08 years in the groups using NOACs and warfarin, respectively. Compared with the HR for the group using warfarin, the HR for dementia was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.73-0.92; <i>P</i>=0.0004) in the group using NOACs. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that users of NOAC aged 65 to 74 years, with a high risk of stroke or bleeding were associated with a lower risk of dementia than users of warfarin with similar characteristics. Conclusions Patients with AF using NOACs were associated with a lower risk of dementia than those using warfarin.

Absent patella,8088781,"Usher syndrome type 1 (US1) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by profound congenital hearing impairment with unintelligible speech, early retinitis pigmentosa, and constant vestibular dysfunction. Three localizations have been described in US1: USH1A, 14q32; USH1B, 11q13.5; and USH1C, 11p15.

Early Infantile Epileptic Encephalopathy,31623145,"The use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) over the last 30 years has rapidly increased both in the United States and worldwide. PPIs are not only very widely used both for approved indications (peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Helicobacter pylori eradication regimens, stress ulcer prevention), but are also one of the most frequently off-label used drugs (25-70% of total). An increasing number of patients with moderate to advanced gastroesophageal reflux disease are remaining on PPI indefinitely. Whereas numerous studies show PPIs remain effective and safe, most of these studies are <5 years of duration and little data exist for >10 years of treatment. Recently, based primarily on observational/epidemiological studies, there have been an increasing number of reports raising issues about safety and side-effects with very long-term chronic treatment. Some of these safety issues are related to the possible long-term effects of chronic hypergastrinemia, which occurs in all patients taking chronic PPIs, others are related to the hypo-/achlorhydria that frequently occurs with chronic PPI treatment, and in others the mechanisms are unclear. These issues have raised considerable controversy in large part because of lack of long-term PPI treatment data (>10-20 years). Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (ZES) is caused by ectopic secretion of gastrin from a neuroendocrine tumor resulting in severe acid hypersecretion requiring life-long antisecretory treatment with PPIs, which are the drugs of choice. Because in <30% of patients with ZES, a long-term cure is not possible, these patients have life-long hypergastrinemia and require life-long treatment with PPIs. Therefore, ZES patients have been proposed as a good model of the long-term effects of hypergastrinemia in man as well as the effects/side-effects of very long-term PPI treatment. In this article, the insights from studies on ZES into these controversial issues with pertinence to chronic PPI use in non-ZES patients is reviewed, primarily concentrating on data from the prospective long-term studies of ZES patients at NIH.",0.8047492504119873,True

Spinal muscular atrophy type 3,33673398,"It has been well-established that cancer cells are under constant oxidative stress, as reflected by elevated basal level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), due to increased metabolism driven by aberrant cell growth. Cancer cells can adapt to maintain redox homeostasis through a variety of mechanisms. The prevalent perception about ROS is that they are one of the key drivers promoting tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and drug resistance. Based on this notion, numerous antioxidants that aim to mitigate tumor oxidative stress have been tested for cancer prevention or treatment, although the effectiveness of this strategy has yet to be established. In recent years, it has been increasingly appreciated that ROS have a complex, multifaceted role in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and that tumor redox can be targeted to amplify oxidative stress inside the tumor to cause tumor destruction. Accumulating evidence indicates that cancer immunotherapies can alter tumor redox to intensify tumor oxidative stress, resulting in ROS-dependent tumor rejection. Herein we review the recent progresses regarding the impact of ROS on cancer cells and various immune cells in the TME, and discuss the emerging ROS-modulating strategies that can be used in combination with cancer immunotherapies to achieve enhanced antitumor effects.",0.7978499531745911,True

Carnevale Hernandez Castillo syndrome,23291099,"Enshi prefecture of Hubei Province is well known for human selenium (Se) poisoning in the early 1960s in China. Sporadic cases of Se poisoning in livestocks are still being found. In this study, Se levels in water, cropland soils and various crops from high-Se areas of Enshi were measured to investigate the distribution and bioavailability of Se in the environments, as well as probable daily intake (PDI) of Se for local residents. The total Se in surface water ranged from 2.0 to 519.3μg/L with a geometric mean of 46.0±127.8 μg/L (n=48), 70.5-99.5% of which was present in the form of Se(VI). The soil Se concentration varied from 2.89 to 87.3 μg/g with a geometric mean of 9.36±18.6 μg/g (n=45), and most of Se was associated with organic matter (OM-Se). The total Se in rice, corn, and vegetable samples were 2.11±2.87 μg/g (n=21), 3.76±11.6 μg/g (n=16), and 2.09±3.38 μg/g (n=25), respectively. Stream water Se is likely leached from carbonaceous shale and mine wastes, leading to Se accumulation in paddy soils. OM-Se may play an important role in Se uptake by rice plant in high-Se area of Enshi. The PDI of Se is approximately 2144 μg/day, and Se concentration in blood is estimated at about 3248 μg/L, posing a potential chronic Se poisoning risk to local residents. Cereal consumption (48.5%) makes a great contribution to human daily Se intake, followed by vegetables (36.6%), meats (8.5%), and drinking water (6.4%). However, when assessing health risk on human in high-Se areas, the contribution of drinking water to daily Se intake cannot be ignored due to high Se content and dominant Se(VI) species.

Our aim was to define the characteristics of the second primary neoplasms affecting the eye and its adnexa and find the risk modifying factors for them after malignancies elsewhere in the body.<h4>Methods</h4>We have queried the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End-Results ""SEER""-9 program of the National Cancer Institute for the malignancies of the eye and its adnexa that occurred between 1973 and 2015. The malignancies were ordered chronologically according to their incidence: first or second primary malignancies. The tumors were classified according to ICD-O-3 classification. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and survival probabilities were calculated for subgroups.<h4>Results</h4>Among 3,578,950 cancer patients, 1203 experienced a second malignancies of the eye and its adnexa.

Barth syndrome,34187112,"<h4>Objectives</h4>To review the data of infants and children with suspected monogenic diabetes who underwent genetic testing.<h4>Methods</h4>Monogenic diabetes is a rare form of diabetes resulting from mutations in a single gene. It can be caused by dominant as well as recessive modes of inheritance. In a country like Pakistan where interfamily marriages are common the incidence of genetic disorders is increased. As Pakistan a resource-poor country, the diagnosis of insulin-dependent diabetes is often delayed and a genetic diagnosis of monogenic diabetes is extremely difficult. Children with clinical diagnosis of monogenic and syndromic diabates were recruited and blood samples were sent for genetic analysis.<h4>Results</h4>One thousand sixty four new cases diagnosed with type 1 diabetes were registered at the National Institute of Child Health, Karachi, in the last 10 years. Of these 39 patients were selected for genetic testing who were diagnosed with diabetes/had a sibling diagnosed with diabetes before the age of nine months (n = 27) or had extra pancreatic features ( n= 12). We identified mutations in 18/27 cases diagnosed with diabetes before nine months of age.

We are not covering all ISDs in this review, but take a few as the most representative, including nonbullous and bullous diseases. The question we are aiming to address can be summarized as follows: 'despite the differences, is it possible to define some unifying epidemiologic characteristics and shared progression pathways which can guide the organization of healthcare?'<b>Areas covered</b>: This review covers incidence, prevalence, risk factors and prognosis of psoriasis, atopic dermatitis (AD), pemphigus and pemphigoid. Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library were searched for papers published between January 2005 and December 2019.<b>Expert opinion</b>: ISDs epidemiology varies according to the ISD type, age, sex, climate, and sociodemographic variables. AD and psoriasis pose a considerable public health burden owing to their high prevalence worldwide and morbidity. Their secular trend of increasing incidence points to a role for environmental factors and gene-environment interactions. Bullous diseases are much rarer, with limited data available. Worldwide, the leading cause of skin disease disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) is attributable to AD.

Biliary tract cancer,32483922,"The relationship between autoinflammatory and autoimmune conditions has been demonstrated in recent decades. Several autoimmune conditions exhibit an autoinflammatory component, which can manifest in various ways. Neutrophilic dermatosis in the context of lupus erythematosus (LE) is one example. Otherwise, neutrophils are rare in LE, except for the bullous variant and nonbullous neutrophilic LE. In this paper, we describe a case of scarring alopecia due to LE that stopped responding to a treatment that had been effective for years. The biopsy specimen demonstrated the presence of neutrophils in the inflammatory infiltrate. A treatment with dapsone was prescribed and yielded rapid improvement. This first case of scarring alopecia in the context of nonbullous neutrophilic LE emphasizes the importance of the infiltrate in determining the optimal therapeutic choice.",0.7841994166374207,True

With the exception of the HIV-associated lipodystrophy, they have a very low prevalence, which together with their large phenotypic heterogeneity makes their identification difficult, even for endocrinologists and pediatricians. This leads to significant delays in diagnosis or even to misdiagnosis. Our group has developed an algorithm that identifies the more than 40 rare lipodystrophy subtypes described to date. This algorithm has been implemented in a free mobile application, LipoDDx®. Our aim was to establish the effectiveness of LipoDDx®. Forty clinical records of patients with a diagnosis of certainty of most lipodystrophy subtypes were analyzed, including subjects without lipodystrophy. The medical records, blinded for diagnosis, were evaluated by 13 physicians, 1 biochemist and 1 dentist. Each evaluator first gave his/her results based on his/her own criteria. Then, a second diagnosis was given using LipoDDx®.

Hypochondroplasia,32290039,"Auditory neuropathy spectrum disorder (ANSD) refers to a range of hearing impairments characterized by deteriorated speech perception, despite relatively preserved pure-tone detection thresholds. Affected individuals usually present with abnormal auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), but normal otoacoustic emissions (OAEs). These electrophysiological characteristics have led to the hypothesis that ANSD may be caused by various dysfunctions at the cochlear inner hair cell (IHC) and spiral ganglion neuron (SGN) levels, while the activity of outer hair cells (OHCs) is preserved, resulting in discrepancies between pure-tone and speech comprehension thresholds. The exact prevalence of ANSD remains unknown; clinical findings show a large variability among subjects with hearing impairment ranging from mild to profound hearing loss. A wide range of prenatal and postnatal etiologies have been proposed. The study of genetics and of the implicated sites of lesion correlated with clinical findings have also led to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the various forms of ANSD, and may guide clinicians in better screening, assessment and treatment of ANSD patients. Besides OAEs and ABRs, audiological assessment includes stapedial reflex measurements, supraliminal psychoacoustic tests, electrocochleography (ECochG), auditory steady-state responses (ASSRs) and cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs). Hearing aids are indicated in the treatment of ANSD with mild to moderate hearing loss, whereas cochlear implantation is the first choice of treatment in case of profound hearing loss, especially in case of IHC presynaptic disorders, or in case of poor auditory outcomes with conventional hearing aids.",0.7824649810791016,True

Ring chromosome 11,34136529,"<b>Background:</b> Endolymphatic hydrops (EH) is the histopathological hallmark of Ménière's disease (MD) and has been found by <i>in vivo</i> magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with several inner ear syndromes without definite MD criteria. The incidence and relevance of this finding is under debate. <b>Purpose:</b> The purpose of the study is to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics of EH and audiovestibular test results in groups of patients with fluctuating audiovestibular symptoms not fulfilling the actual criteria for definite MD and compare them with a similar group of patients with definite MD and a group of patients with recent idiopathic sudden neurosensory hearing loss (ISSNHL). <b>Material and Methods:</b> 170 patients were included, 83 with definite MD, 38 with fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, 34 with recurrent vertigo, and 15 with ISSNHL. The clinical variables, audiovestibular tests, and EH were evaluated and compared. Logistic proportional hazard models were used to obtain the odds ratio for hydrops development, including a multivariable adjusted model for potential confounders. <b>Results:</b> No statistical differences between groups were found regarding disease duration, episodes, Tumarkin spells, migraine, vascular risk factors, or vestibular tests; only hearing loss showed differences. Regarding EH, we found significant differences between groups, with odds ratio (OR) for EH presence in definite MD group vs. all other patients of 11.43 (4.5-29.02; <i>p</i> < 0.001).

Eunuchoidism familial hypogonadotropic,33045602,"Although benzothiazole and its derivatives (BTHs) are considered emerging contaminants in diverse environments and organisms, little information is available about their contamination profiles and health impact in ambient particles.

The total BTH concentration (ΣBTHs) in PM<sub>2.5</sub> samples from the three cities decreased in the order of Guangzhou > Shanghai > Taiyuan, independently of the PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration. Despite the large variation in concentration of ΣBTHs in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, 2-hydroxybenzothiazole (OTH) was always the predominant compound among the PM<sub>2.5</sub>-bound BTHs and accounted for 50-80% of total BTHs in the three regions. Results from human exposure assessment and toxicity screening indicated that the outdoor exposure risk of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-bound BTHs in toddlers was much higher than in adults, especially for OTH. The developmental and reproduction toxicity of OTH was further explored in vivo and in vitro.

CD4 deficiency,6750,"The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and type 2 (HTLV-2) are two pathogenic retroviruses. Although both viruses share a common genome organization and amino acid homology in common viral proteins, the incidence of disease with infection is distinct. Infection with HTLV-1 may result in the development of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), an aggressive neoplastic disease, or a variety of immune-mediated/inflammatory disorders such as HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP), whereas HTLV-2 is less pathogenic. Our studies focused on the open reading frame II encoded p28 protein of HTLV-2, which has been shown to negatively regulate viral expression by the nuclear retention of the tax/rex mRNA. A similar post-transcriptional regulatory function has been observed with HTLV-1 ORF-II p30. However, p28 contrasts p30 in that there appears to be no significant transcriptional effects.In Chapter 2, we examined the functional significance of p28 in HTLV-2 infection, proliferation, and immortalization of primary T-cells in culture, and viral infection and survival in a rabbit model of HTLV infection. We generated a novel HTLV-2 p28 termination clone (HTLV2Deltap28) in which a stop codon had been introduced into the p28 sequence without altering the amino acid sequence of the overlapping regulatory proteins, Tax and Rex. In short-term proliferation and long-term immortalization coculture assays, HTLV2Deltap28 infected and immortalized primary human T-cells, similar to wtHTLV-2. However, HTLV2Deltap28 had a lower capacity to establish persistent infection in rabbits, indicating the in vivo importance of HTLV-2 p28. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that p28 repression of Tax and Rex-mediated viral gene expression allows infected cells to avoid immune recognition and elimination, or acts to enhance early viral spread by enhancing the survival of HTLV-2 infected cells.In Chapter 3, we generated and characterized various dual-promoter and single-promoter lentiviral expression vectors. Post-transduction, p28 protein was readily detected with the dual-promoter vectors in 293T cells but not in Jurkat T-cells. The differential p28 protein expression was found to be due to cell-type specific translation mechanisms. To circumvent this problem we utilized a single-promoter lentiviral vector that expresses p28 via the murine stem cell virus (MSCV)-promoter, which resulted in efficient p28 protein expression in both T-cell lines and primary human CD8+ T-lymphocytes. In Chapter 4, the capacity of p28 to modify cellular gene expression was examined. In transient transfection studies, low doses of p28 modulated CRE- and NFκB-driven reporter constructs in 293T cells, suggesting the ability of p28 in modulating cellular gene expression. Interestingly, transduction of Jurkat T-cells with the lentiviral p28 expression vector had no significant effect on cellular proliferation. Additionally, initial analysis of global cellular gene expression by microarray analysis suggests that p28 results in nominal alterations in cellular gene expression. Collectively, data presented in this thesis indicates that p28 is critical for the establishment and survival of HTLV-2, compatible with the conclusion that the regulation of HTLV gene expression is a tightly controlled and complex process. Ultimately, while minimal, the impact of p28 upon cellular genes likely contributes to HTLV-2 establishment of infection in vivo.",0.7617145776748657,True

Studies reporting case series of XGP (more than ten cases) were included if they were relevant to this study.<h4>Results</h4>Twenty-seven patients were diagnosed with XGP, and 26 of them were histologically proven to have XGP. A total of 81.5% of the patients were female and the mean age was 59.6 years (SD 19.2). The most frequent symptoms were flank pain (70.4%) and fever (59.3%), while 77.8% of patients had renal stones. Proteus mirabilis was detected in the urine culture in 18.5% of patients, followed by detection of Escherichia coli in 14.8% of patients. The computed tomography (CT) findings included perirenal (29.6%) or pararenal (29.6%) involvement in the majority of patients. Twenty-six patients underwent nephrectomy. Piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriaxone were the most commonly prescribed antibiotics for treatment. The reported piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftriaxone resistance rates were 14.3% and 16.6%, respectively. Twenty-six case series were included in the literature review, reporting 693 cases in total.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We found well-established characteristics of XGP patients among series in terms of previous history, clinical, laboratory and imaging findings, and operative and postoperative outcomes. It is important to know the clinical presentation and potential severity of XGP, as well as the most frequently involved microorganisms and their antibiotic resistance profiles, to select the most appropriate antibiotic therapy.",0.7614357471466064,True

Proliferative verrucous leukoplakia,33624225,"In this study analysis of soil, water and plant residue samples is presented to evaluate the contamination levels and possible health risks. Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) is a persistent organic pollutant used as a pesticide in agricultural sector for pest control in order to obtain higher productivity. For analysis soil, water and crop residue samples were collected from different agricultural areas of the northern Punjab region of Pakistan. The investigation of the samples shows significant levels of HCH residues in all types of samples. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis was used to assess the higher residue levels of HCH in the samples. The concentration of HCH residues detected in samples ranged from 2.43 to 8.88 µg/g in soil, nd -5.87 µg/l in water and nd - 4.87 µg/g in plants. The presence of HCH residues in soil, water and plant samples was beyond the recommended quality guidelines. Human health risk was evaluated for cancer and non-cancer risks through dietary and non-dietary exposure routes. The hazard index was HI > 1 in children and HI < 1 in adults, while the non-dietary incremental lifetime cancer risks (ILCR) were beyond the internationally acceptable limit of 1 × 10<sup>-5</sup>. Hence, results of the present investigation concluded the presence of high levels of HCH residues in samples and pose high health risk to the inhabitants. These findings are alarming and apprise the concerned departments for the remediation of contamination and proper implementation of environmental laws in the area.",0.7613815665245056,True
Nelson syndrome,29494725,"Importance:Congenital retinal macrovessel (CRM) is a rarely reported venous malformation of the retina that is associated with venous anomalies of the brain. Objective:To study the multimodal imaging findings of a series of eyes with congenital retinal macrovessel and describe the systemic associations. Design, Setting, and Participants:In this cross-sectional multicenter study, medical records were retrospectively reviewed from 7 different retina clinics worldwide over a 10-year period (2007-2017). Patients with CRM, defined as an abnormal, large, macular vessel with a vascular distribution above and below the horizontal raphe, were identified. Data were analyzed from December 2016 to August 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures:Clinical information and multimodal retinal imaging findings were collected and studied. Pertinent systemic information, including brain magnetic resonance imaging findings, was also noted if available. Results:Of the 49 included patients, 32 (65%) were female, and the mean (SD) age at onset was 44.0 (20.9) years. A total of 49 eyes from 49 patients were studied. Macrovessel was unilateral in all patients. Color fundus photography illustrated a large aberrant dilated and tortuous retinal vein in all patients. Early-phase frames of fluorescein angiography further confirmed the venous nature of the macrovessel in 40 of 40 eyes. Optical coherence tomography angiography, available in 17 eyes (35%), displayed microvascular capillary abnormalities around the CRM, which were more evident in the deep capillary plexus. Of the 49 patients with CRM, 39 (80%) did not illustrate any evidence of ophthalmic complications. Ten patients (20%) presented with retinal complications, typically an incidental association with CRM. Twelve patients (24%) were noted to have venous malformations of the brain with associated magnetic resonance imaging. Of these, location of the venous anomaly in the brain was ipsilateral to the CRM in 10 patients (83%) and contralateral in 2 patients (17%), mainly located in the frontal lobe in 9 patients (75%). Conclusions and Relevance:Our study has identified an association between macrovessels in the retina and venous anomalies of the brain (24% compared with 0.2% to 6.0% in the normal population). Thus, we recommend new guidelines for the systemic workup of patients with CRM to include brain magnetic resonance imaging with contrast. These lesions may be more accurately referred to as retinal venous malformations, which may raise awareness regarding potential cerebral associations.",0.761358380317688,True
Spontaneous coronary artery dissection,34159584,"The aim of this study was to analyze the genetic variants of 51 Chinese patients with distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) and explore the correlation between their genotype and phenotype. Eight variants of SLC4A1, 19 variants of ATP6V0A4, and 16 variants of ATP6V1B1 have been identified, and of which 14 were novel ones. Eleven patients with autosomal dominant dRTA, and four patients with autosomal recessive dRTA were caused by genetic defects in SLC4A1; 18 and nine patients with recessive dRTA were resulted by defects in ATP6V0A4 and ATP6V1B1 respectively; no causal gene was identified in seven patients. Mutation frequency of SLC4A1 in Chinese populations was more common than Europeans. The incidence of deafness in ATP6V0A4 and ATP6V1B1 groups was 16.7% and 54.5%, respectively. The frequency of CKD in adults, children and infants was 100%, 51%, and 3%, separately.

Lissencephaly X-linked,31022678,"<h4>Background</h4>The combination of esophageal atresia, congenital duodenal obstruction, and anorectal malformation has seldom been reported. We describe the largest series of patients with such association, which we summed up with the mnemonic acronym DATE [D-duodenal obstruction, A-anorectal malformation (ARM), and TE-tracheoesophageal fistula with esophageal atresia].<h4>Methods</h4>This was a multicenter retrospective review of 13 patients recruited from 8 institutions over a nearly 5-decade period (1968-2017). Information gathered included type of DATE malformations, other associated anomalies, type and timing of surgery, and clinical outcomes.<h4>Results</h4>The DATE association consisted of type C esophageal atresia (13), complete (9) or incomplete (4) congenital duodenal obstruction (CDO), and high or intermediate (8) or low (5) ARM. Eight patients had at least one additional component feature of VACTERL association. A total of 6 patients died. Overall, 9 patients achieved complete restoration of gastrointestinal continuity, 7 of whom are alive at a median follow-up of 4 y (range, 1 to 9). Survivors received a median of 6 major operations (range, 4 to 14) to overcome their anomalies and surgical complications. Two incomplete duodenal obstructions were initially overlooked. All survivors with high or intermediate ARM defects required some form of bowel management to keep them clean.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The DATE association is a low-frequency entity, often occurring among the wider spectrum of VACTERL association. Functional outcomes largely depend on the severity of ARM or other major associated malformations. Awareness of the DATE association may avoid untoward diagnostic delays of subtler component features of the spectrum, such as an incomplete CDO.",0.7581095695495605,True
Lelis syndrome,33045540,"<h4>Background and aims</h4>one of the health concerns for any society is to have its own standard of growth. The aim of this study was to provide the age- and sex-specific percentile values of anthropometric measures for adolescents of developing countries. The use of global percentiles in developing countries overestimates underweight and stunting while underestimates overweight and obesity.<h4>Methods</h4>The data were obtained from the Global School-based Student Health Survey (GSHS). This study was conducted on school students, selected by multistage random cluster sampling from 73 developing countries. A parametric method was used for constructing age-specific reference intervals (normal ranges).<h4>Results</h4>In general, 210,045 11-18 years-old schoolchildren (14.38 ± 1.39) from 73 developing countries between 2003 and 2014 were included in this study, among which 103,080 (49.08%) were male and 106,965 (50.92%) were female. Calculation of body mass index (BMI) percentile showed that for all BMI percentile curves of both sexes, there was a gradual increase up to the age of around 15 years, and then remain stable (except for 95th percentile). Moreover in all weight percentile curves of boys, except 90th and above, there was a slight rise until the age of 18 years. In 10th height percentile curves and above in boys, there was a sharp increase up to the age of 17, followed by a decline.

2-Hydroxyglutaric aciduria,33741306,"Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is a rare form of cholecystitis, characterized by the presence of xanthogranuloma, prominent yellow structures within the gallbladder wall that is very often lithiasic. When XGC presents in its pseudo-tumoral form with occasional adjacent organ involvement, it can mimic gallbladder carcinoma (GBC). The etiopathogenesis of XGC is inflammatory destruction of Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses containing biliary and cholesterol pigments within the gallbladder wall; this leads to a florid granulomatous histiocytic inflammatory reaction. The prevalence ranges from 1.3% to 8.8% of all cholecystectomies and varies from country to country; XGC occurs predominantly in patients over 50 years of age, and is equally distributed between males and females. Its association with GBC remains a topic of debate in the literature (between 0 and 20%). Symptoms are non-specific and generally similar to those of acute or chronic cholecystitis. XGC, when associated with altered health status, leads to the suspicion of GBC. XGC can also come to light due to an acute complication of cholecystolithiasis, in particular, gallstone migration. Imaging by sonography and CT scan is suggestive, but magnetic resonance imaging is more specific. In difficult cases, biopsy may be necessary to eliminate the diagnosis of tumor. In case of pre- or intra-operative diagnostic doubt, the opinion of a hepatobiliary specialty center can be of help. When diagnosis of GBC has been eliminated, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is recommended, although with a high risk of conversion to laparotomy and complications.",0.7524770498275757,True

Rare intellectual disability without developmental anomaly,28637916,"Bubonic plague has caused three deadly pandemics in human history: from the mid-sixth to mid-eighth century, from the mid-fourteenth to the mid-eighteenth century and from the end of the nineteenth until the mid-twentieth century. Between the second and the third pandemics, plague was causing sporadic outbreaks in only a few countries in the Middle East, including Egypt. Little is known about this historical phase of plague, even though it represents the temporal, geographical and phylogenetic transition between the second and third pandemics. Here we analysed in detail an outbreak of plague that took place in Cairo in 1801, and for which epidemiological data are uniquely available thanks to the presence of medical officers accompanying the Napoleonic expedition into Egypt at that time. We propose a new stochastic model describing how bubonic plague outbreaks unfold in both rat and human populations, and perform Bayesian inference under this model using a particle Markov chain Monte Carlo. Rat carcasses were estimated to be infectious for approximately 4 days after death, which is in good agreement with local observations on the survival of infectious rat fleas. The estimated transmission rate between rats implies a basic reproduction number <i>R</i><sub>0</sub> of approximately 3, causing the collapse of the rat population in approximately 100 days. Simultaneously, the force of infection exerted by each infected rat carcass onto the human population increases progressively by more than an order of magnitude. We also considered human-to-human transmission via pneumonic plague or human specific vectors, but found this route to account for only a small fraction of cases and to be significantly below the threshold required to sustain an outbreak.",0.7406953573226929,True

The aim of this study was to determine the rate, risk factors, and causes of neonatal mortality in Jordan. <b>Methods:</b> In August 2019, an electronic stillbirths and neonatal deaths surveillance system (JSANDS) was established in in three large cities through five hospitals. Data on all births, neonatal mortality and their causes, and other characteristics in the period between August 2019 and January 2020 were exported from the JSANDS and analyzed. <b>Results:</b> A total of 10,328 births [10,226 live births (LB) and 102 stillbirths] were registered in the study period, with a rate of 14.1 deaths per 1,000 LBs; 76% were early neonatal deaths and 24% were late deaths. The odds of deaths in the Ministry of Health hospitals were almost 21 times (OR = 20.8, 95% CI: 2.8, 153.1) higher than that in private hospitals. Low birthweight and pre-term babies were significantly more likely to die during the neonatal period compared to full-term babies. The odds of neonatal mortality were significantly higher among babies born to housewives compared to those who were born to employed women (OR = 2.7; 95% CI: 1.2, 6.0). Main causes of neonatal deaths that occurred pre-discharge were respiratory and cardiovascular disorders (43%) and low birthweight and pre-term (33%). The main maternal conditions that attributed to these deaths were complications of the placenta and cord, complications of pregnancy, and medical and surgical conditions. The main cause of neonatal deaths that occurred post-discharge were low birthweight and pre-term (42%). <b>Conclusions:</b> The rate of neonatal mortality have not decreased since 2012 and the majority of neonatal deaths occurred could have been prevented.

Observational controlled studies including TGA patients (Caplan, Hodges and Warlow) were retrieved. Quality evaluation was based on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The prevalence of migraine was compared in TGA patients vs. healthy controls (HC), as well as in TGA against TIA individuals. Data from case-control, cross-sectional and cohort studies were pooled separately.<h4>Results</h4>Literature search yielded 1178 articles, 12 of which were included in the present meta-analysis. Results from case-control (ten), cohort (one) and cross-sectional (one) studies were compatible with an association between TGA and migraine. The nationwide inpatient cross-sectional study was of lesser value due to its inpatient orientation. The high-quality, population-based, retrospective cohort (158,301 participants per group) determined a higher relative-risk (RR) of TGA for migraine vs. non-migraine individuals [RR = 2.48, 95%confidence-interval (95% CI) = (1.32, 4.87)]. Sensitivity testing based on stricter diagnostic criteria strengthened the estimated association [RR = 3.84, 95% CI = (1.57, 9.38)]. Additionally, pooled data from eight case-control studies (700 TGA, 746 HC) yielded similar results [Odds-Ratio, OR = 2.51, 95% CI = (1.85, 3.41)], with the association mainly driven by the three high-quality studies, rather than the five articles of moderate quality. Finally, pooled findings from four case-control studies of moderate-quality revealed a higher prevalence of migraine among TGA compared to TIA patients [OR = 1.82, 95% CI = (1.22, 2.73)].<h4>Conclusions</h4>A significant association between TGA and migraine was established.

N acetyltransferase deficiency,34134655,"<h4>Background</h4>Hereditary cancer susceptibility syndrome (HCSS) contributes to the cancer predisposition at an early age, therefore, identification of HCSS has found to be crucial for surveillance, managing therapeutic interventions and refer the patients and their families for genetic counselling. The study aimed to identify ALL patients who meet the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) criteria and refer them for the genetic testing for HCSS as hereditary leukemia and hematologic malignancy syndrome, and to elucidate the significance of high consanguinity with the prevalence of inherited leukemia in Pakistani population.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 300 acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients were recruited from the Children's Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan from December 2018 to September 2019. A structured self-reporting questionnaire based on family and medical history of the disease was utilized for the data collection.<h4>Results</h4>In our cohort, 60.40% of ALL patients were identified to meet ACMG criteria. Among them, a large number of patients (40.65%) solely fulfil the criteria due to the presence of parental consanguinity. However, parental consanguinity showed protective impact on the onset at early age of disease [OD = 0.44 (0.25-0.77), p-value = 0.00] while, a family history of cancer increased the risk of cardiotoxicity [OD = 2.46 (1.15-5.24), p-value = 0.02]. Parental consanguinity shows no significant impact on the family history of cancer and the number of relatives with cancer.<h4>Conclusions</h4>More than 50% of the ALL patients were considered the strong candidates' for genetic testing of HCSS in the Pakistani population, and parental consanguinity was the leading criteria fulfilled by the individuals when assessed through ACMG guidelines. Our study suggests revisiting ACMG guidelines, especially for the criterion of parental consanguinity, and formulating the score based criteria based on; genetic research, the toxicology profile, physical features, personal and family history of cancer for the identification of patients for the genetic testing.",0.7239776849746704,True

The data was gathered on site from the medical records. Two hundred and thirty-three alleles with a mutation of the CYP21A2 gene were identified in 126 patients. A genotype-phenotype correlation of the mutation findings was undertaken (C1, severe/mild; C2, mild/mild). Individuals with a heterozygous mutation of the CYP21A2 were also included (C3). The data was collected with the approval of the ethics committee of the University Hospital of Erlangen during the period of 2014 and 2015. RESULTS (MW ± SD): One hundred and seventeen out of 134 patients (115 f, 29 m) were symptomatic. The chronological age (CA) at diagnosis was 7.1 ± 4.4 years. The most frequent symptom (73.5%) was premature pubarche. The height-SDS on diagnosis was 0.8 ± 1.3 and the BMI-SDS was 0.8 ± 1.2. Bone age (BA) was ascertained in 82.9% of the symptomatic patients. The difference between BA and CA was 1.9 ± 1.4 years. Basal 17OHP concentrations were 14.5 ± 19.1 ng/ml (18 patients < 2 ng/ml). In total, 58.1% mild and 34.7% severe mutations were found. The most common mutation was p.Val281Leu (39.1%); 65.8% of the patients could be allocated to group C1. No phenotypical differences were found between the 3 mutation groups. The 17OHP levels (basal and after ACTH) in the standard ACTH stimulation test were highest in group C1 and also significantly higher in group C2 as in C3, the ACTH-stimulated cortisol levels (ng/ml) were significantly lower in groups C1 (192.1 ± 62.5) and C2 (218 ± 50) than in C3 (297.3 ± 98.7).<h4>Conclusion</h4>Most of the patients have symptoms of mild androgenisation. Male patients are underdiagnosed. Diagnostics are not standardised. Differences between the types of mutations are found in the hormone concentrations but not in phenotype. We speculate that further, as yet not clearly defined, factors are responsible for the development of the respective phenotypes.",0.7208864092826843,True

All patients with an electro-clinical diagnosis of IGE, TLE, or FS were recruited at the outpatient epilepsy clinic at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, from 2008 until 2020. Age, sex, age at seizure onset, seizure type(s), and occurrence of ictal injury at any time since the onset of the seizures and its characteristics were registered routinely for all patients at the time of the first visit.<h4>Results</h4>One thousand and one hundred seventy-four patients were studied (481 patients with IGE, 402 people with TLE, and 291 persons with FS). While the groups differed in their demographic and clinical characteristics, the rates of ictal injury did not differ significantly between the groups. Tongue injury was more frequently reported by patients with TLE compared with that by people with IGE or FS. Other types/locations of ictal injury were more or less reported by all three groups of the patients.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Ictal injuries may happen with more or less similar rates among people with epilepsy (IGE and TLE) and those with FS.

Patients:A cohort of 10,403 patients treated in childhood with recombinant GH in five European countries since this treatment was first used in 1984. Expected rates from national cancer registration statistics. Main Outcome Measures:Risk of meningioma incidence. Results:During follow-up, 38 meningiomas occurred. Meningioma risk was greatly raised in the cohort overall [standardized incidence ratio (SIR) = 75.4; 95% CI: 54.9 to 103.6], as a consequence of high risk in subjects who had received radiotherapy for underlying malignancy (SIR = 658.4; 95% CI: 460.4 to 941.7).

According to the literature, ACC is rarely an incidental imaging finding. However, presentation, treatment and outcome may differ in modern series.<h4>Design and methods</h4>We studied all patients (n = 47, four children) from a single centre during years 2002-2018. We re-evaluated radiologic and histopathological findings and assessed treatments and outcome. We searched for possible TP53 gene defects and assessed nationwide incidence of ACC.<h4>Results</h4>In adults, incidental radiologic finding led to diagnosis in 79% at median age of 61 years. ENSAT stage I, II, III and IV was 19%, 40%, 19% and 21%, respectively. Nonenhanced CT demonstrated > 20 Hounsfield Units (HU) for all tumours (median 34 (21-45)), median size 92 mm (20-196), Ki67 17% (1-40%), Weiss score 7 (4-9) and Helsinki score 24 (4-48). ACC was more often found in the left than the right adrenal (p < 0.05). One child had Beckwith-Wiedemann and one a TP53 mutation. In adults, the primary tumour was resected in 88 and 79% received adjuvant mitotane therapy. Median hospital stay was significantly shorter in the laparoscopic vs. open surgery group (4 (3-7) vs. 8 (5-38) days, respectively; p < 0.001). In 3/4 patients, prolonged remission of > 5 to > 10 years was achieved after repeated surgery of metastases. Overall 5-year survival was 67%, and 96% vs. 26% for ENSAT stage I-II vs. III-IV (p < 0.0001). ENSAT stage and Ki67 predicted survival, type of surgery did not. Mitotane associated with better survival.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Contemporary ACC predominantly presents as an incidental imaging finding, characterised by HU > 20 on nonenhanced CT but variable tumour size (20-196 mm). Malignancy cannot be ruled out by small tumour size only. The 5-year survival of 96% in ENSAT stage I-III compares favourably to previous studies.",0.709551215171814,True
Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy,34117012,"Zika virus (ZIKV) is a vectorborne infectious agent of global public health significance due to its potential to cause severe teratogenic outcomes.

In this analysis, we apply the Wilson-Jungner framework to appraise the potential utility of a prenatal ZIKV screening programme, outline potential screening strategies within the case-finding pathway, and consider other epidemiological factors that may influence the planning of such a screening programme. Our evaluation of a potential prenatal ZIKV screening programme highlights factors affirming its usefulness, including the importance of Congenital Zika Syndrome as a public health problem and the existence of analogous congenital prenatal screening programmes for STORCH agents (syphilis, toxoplasmosis, others (eg, human immunodeficiency virus, varicella-zoster virus, parvovirus B19), rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus). However, our assessment also reveals key barriers to implementation, such as the need for more accurate diagnostic tests, effective antiviral treatments, increased social service capacity, and surveillance.

Fryns smeets thiry syndrome,33462894,"<h4>Aim</h4>To evaluate the risk factors and incidence of Asherman Syndrome in women with post-abortion uterine evacuation and curettage.<h4>Methods</h4>A total of 2546 patients who had surgical abortion (uterine evacuation and curettage) before the 20th gestational week with indications of missed abortion, anembryonic pregnancy, incomplete abortion, and elective curettage in a tertiary antenatal care center were recruited. The patients were called and surveyed for their symptoms; including infertility, oligo-amenorrhea and recurrent pregnancy loss, preterm birth and intrauterine growth retardation and abnormal placentation as criteria of Asherman Syndrome. Diagnostic (office) hysteroscopy was performed for 177 who had one of those complaints.<h4>Results</h4>The incidence of Asherman Syndrome was 1.6% (n = 43/2546). History of ≥3 abortions was the main factor that increased the risk of Asherman Syndrome for by 4.6 times. Use of vacuum aspiration or sharp curettage, premedication for cervical priming, and having a pregnancy >10th gestational weeks were not risk factors for Asherman Syndrome.<h4>Conclusion</h4>When the diagnosis was based on presence of symptoms who underwent uterine instrumentation, the incidence of Asherman Syndrome was found to be 1.6%. Repeated abortions were the main risk factor for Asherman Syndrome and avoiding from repeated uterine instrumentations may have a role in prevention.",0.7030412554740906,True
Lissencephaly X-linked,31741214,"<h4>Purpose</h4>VACTERL association is a rare and complex condition of congenital malformations, often requiring repeated surgery and entailing various physical sequelae. Due to scarcity of knowledge, the study aim was to investigate self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL), anxiety, depression and self-concept in children and adolescents with VACTERL association and self-reported anxiety and depression in their parents.<h4>Methods</h4>Patients aged 8-17 years with VACTERL association and their parents were recruited from three of four Swedish paediatric surgical centres during 2015-2019. The well-established validated questionnaires DISABKIDS, Beck Youth Inventories, Beck Anxiety Inventory and Beck Depression Inventory were sent to the families. Data were analysed using descriptives, t tests and multivariable analysis. Results were compared with norm groups and reference samples.<h4>Results</h4>The questionnaires were returned by 40 patients, 38 mothers and 33 fathers. The mean HRQoL was M = 80.4, comparable to children with asthma (M = 80.2) and diabetes (M = 79.5). Self-reported psychological well-being was comparable to the norm group of Swedish school children, and was significantly higher than a clinical sample. Factors negatively influencing children's HRQoL and psychological well-being were identified. The parents' self-reports of anxiety and depression were comparable to non-clinical samples.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Although children and adolescents with VACTERL association reported similar HRQoL to those of European children with chronic conditions, their psychological well-being was comparable to Swedish school children in general. Nevertheless, some individuals among both children and parents were in need of extra support. This attained knowledge is valuable when counselling parents regarding the prognosis for children with VACTERL association.",0.7003289461135864,True
Scleromyxedema,28794082,"<h4>Background</h4>Insight into type 6 long-QT syndrome (LQT6), stemming from mutations in the <i>KCNE2</i>-encoded voltage-gated channel β-subunit, is limited. We sought to further characterize its clinical phenotype.<h4>Methods and results</h4>Individuals with reported pathogenic <i>KCNE2</i> mutations identified during arrhythmia evaluation were collected from inherited arrhythmia clinics and the Rochester long-QT syndrome (LQTS) registry. Previously reported LQT6 cases were identified through a search of the MEDLINE database. Clinical features were assessed, while reported <i>KCNE2</i> mutations were evaluated for genotype-phenotype segregation and classified according to the contemporary American College of Medical Genetics guidelines. Twenty-seven probands possessed reported pathogenic <i>KCNE2</i> mutations, while a MEDLINE search identified 17 additional LQT6 cases providing clinical and genetic data. Sixteen probands had normal resting QTc values and only developed QT prolongation and malignant arrhythmias after exposure to QT-prolonging stressors, 10 had other LQTS pathogenic mutations, and 10 did not have an LQTS phenotype. Although the remaining 8 subjects had an LQTS phenotype, evidence suggested that the <i>KCNE2</i> variant was not the underlying culprit. The collective frequency of <i>KCNE2</i> variants implicated in LQT6 in the Exome Aggregation Consortium database was 1.4%, in comparison with a 0.0005% estimated clinical prevalence for LQT6.<h4>Conclusions</h4>On the basis of clinical phenotype, the high allelic frequencies of LQT6 mutations in the Exome Aggregation Consortium database, and absence of previous documentation of genotype-phenotype segregation, our findings suggest that many <i>KCNE2</i> variants, and perhaps all, have been erroneously designated as LQTS-causative mutations. Instead, <i>KCNE2</i> variants may confer proarrhythmic susceptibility when provoked by additional environmental/acquired or genetic factors, or both.",0.6992233991622925,True
"Trigonobrachycephaly, bulbous bifid nose, micrognathia, and abnormalities of the hands and feet",33760362,"<h4>Aims</h4>Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is a form of acute myocardial inflammation, often triggered by catecholamine release surges, which accounts for approximately 10% of 'myocardial infarctions' in female patients above the age of 50. Its associated substantial risk of in-hospital mortality is mainly driven by the development of hypotension and shock. While hypotension is induced largely by factors other than low cardiac output, its precise cause is unknown, and clinical parameters associated with hypotension have not been identified previously. We therefore sought to identify the incidence and clinical/laboratory correlates of early hypotension in TTS.<h4>Methods and results</h4>We analysed the in-hospital data of patients recruited to the South Australian TTS Registry. Associations between the development of hypotension, patient demographics, severity of the acute TTS attack, and key biochemical markers were sought. One hundred thirteen out of 319 patients (35%) were hypotensive (median systolic blood pressure 80 mmHg) during their index hospitalization. Development of hypotension preceded all in-hospital deaths (n = 8). On univariate analyses, patients who developed hypotension had lower left ventricular ejection fraction (P = 0.009), and higher plasma N-terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide and troponin-T concentrations (P = 0.046 and 0.008, respectively), all markers of severity of the TTS attack; hypotension also occurred less commonly in male than in female patients (P = 0.014). On multivariate linear regression analysis, female sex and lower left ventricular ejection fraction were independent correlates of the development of hypotension (P = 0.009 and 0.010, respectively).<h4>Conclusions</h4>Early development of hypotension is very common in TTS, and its presence is associated with a substantial risk of in-hospital mortality. Hypotension is a marker of severe TTS attacks and occurs more commonly in female TTS patients.",0.6981258988380432,True
Infantile free sialic acid storage disease,33317716,"Short-term VEEG represents an affordable option in limited resources environments. There are few reports on its use. Its diagnostic yield is variable (7-57%) and can be related to the differences in recording time. The present study analyzes possible predictive factors to support the indication of a short-term VEEG. We analyzed short-term VEEG studies (<24 h) throughout a period of 5 years (2013-2017). The patients were clustered according to the date of last epileptic seizure and the frequency of epileptic events per month and subcategorized depending on the frequency found. Chi square univariate analysis was performed looking for predictive variables to obtain an epileptic short-term EEG. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed with statistically significant variables. A total of 1092 VEEG were analyzed from 832 patients. 34.5% were reported as epileptic VEEG.

"Ichthyosis hystrix, Curth Macklin type",32964257,"<h4>Background</h4>Orbital hypertelorism (OHT) represents a congenital condition defined by lateralization of the bony orbit, unlike soft tissue telecanthus in which there is an increase in intercanthal distance without true bony lateralization. Existing literature remains very limited in its postoperative assessment of bony versus soft tissue relapse, which may both clinically present as telecanthus. We performed a critical appraisal of the literature to determine the postoperative incidence of bony versus soft tissue relapse following OHT repair.<h4>Methods</h4>The PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and clinicaltrials.org were searched systematically for all English studies published in any time frame reporting relapse rates following primary OHT repair. The primary outcome was incidence of bony and soft tissue relapse defined as orbital lateralization and medial canthal drift, respectively. The secondary outcome measures include postoperative complications, predictors of postoperative complications, timing and type of surgery, and revision rates.<h4>Results</h4>Eleven articles were included. A total of 84 (35.3%) patients experienced bony relapse while 43 (27.2%) patients experienced soft tissue relapse. Age at time of intervention (p < 0.92), severity at presentation (p < 0.90), and surgical technique (p < 0.09) were not found be significantly associated with relapse rate. Methods for long-term follow-up were not standardized, and there was no consistent measure to objectively assess telecanthus.<h4>Conclusions</h4>There is no general consensus on predictive factors of long-term relapse following OHT repair in the form of box osteotomy or facial bipartition.

The criteria for XGC in the pathology specimens were the presence of histiocytes, cholesterol deposits, lipids, and focal or widespread wall enlargement.<h4>Results</h4>Patients were diagnosed with XGC, of which 52 (65.8%) were male and 27 (34.2%) were female, creating a male-to-female ratio of 2:1. The mean age was 65.8 ± 14.3 years (range, 36-97 years). The most common presenting symptom was abdominal pain (63.3%), and the least common presenting symptom was jaundice (8.9%). Of the total, 25 patients were found to have pathological conditions with the potential to obstruct the bile duct or to slow bile flow. A frozen section examination was performed on 20 patients due to suspicion of a tumor by intraoperative macroscopic examination. However, no malignancy was detected in the cases who underwent a frozen section examination. An increase in wall thickness of the gallbladder was observed in 81.6% (n = 31) of the patients on computed tomography scans and in 81.8% (n = 18) of the patients on magnetic resonance imaging scans in which possible tumor lesions were reported, but no tumor was detected.<h4>Conclusion</h4>It is difficult to diagnose XGC either preoperatively or intraoperatively, and further imaging methods are needed in the preoperative period other than ultrasonography.

"Pulmonary hypoplasia, familial primary",31329379,"<h4>Background</h4>A preliminary safety signal for neural-tube defects was previously reported in association with dolutegravir exposure from the time of conception, which has affected choices of antiretroviral treatment (ART) for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected women of reproductive potential. The signal can now be evaluated with data from follow-up of additional pregnancies.<h4>Methods</h4>We conducted birth-outcomes surveillance at hospitals throughout Botswana, expanding from 8 to 18 sites in 2018. Trained midwives performed surface examinations of all live-born and stillborn infants. Research assistants photographed abnormalities after maternal consent was obtained. The prevalence of neural-tube defects and major external structural defects according to maternal HIV infection and ART exposure status was determined. In the primary analyses, we used the Newcombe method to evaluate differences in prevalence with 95% confidence intervals.<h4>Results</h4>From August 2014 through March 2019, surveillance captured 119,477 deliveries; 119,033 (99.6%) had an infant surface examination that could be evaluated, and 98 neural-tube defects were identified (0.08% of deliveries). Among 1683 deliveries in which the mother was taking dolutegravir at conception, 5 neural-tube defects were found (0.30% of deliveries); the defects included two instances of myelomeningocele, one of anencephaly, one of encephalocele, and one of iniencephaly. In comparison, 15 neural-tube defects were found among 14,792 deliveries (0.10%) in which the mother was taking any non-dolutegravir ART at conception, 3 among 7959 (0.04%) in which the mother was taking efavirenz at conception, 1 among 3840 (0.03%) in which the mother started dolutegravir treatment during pregnancy, and 70 among 89,372 (0.08%) in HIV-uninfected mothers. The prevalence of neural-tube defects was higher in association with dolutegravir treatment at conception than with non-dolutegravir ART at conception (difference, 0.20 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01 to 0.59) or with other types of ART exposure. Major external structural defects were found in 0.95% of deliveries among women exposed to dolutegravir at conception and 0.68% of those among women exposed to non-dolutegravir ART at conception (difference, 0.27 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.13 to 0.87).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prevalence of neural-tube defects was slightly higher in association with dolutegravir exposure at conception than with other types of ART exposure at conception (3 per 1000 deliveries vs. 1 per 1000 deliveries).

Cataract and congenital ichthyosis,33621800,"<h4>Introduction</h4>Children account for a relatively small proportion of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections. In children, COVID-19 usually has a relatively mild course. However, in rare cases, severe disorders can be observed, and clinical manifestations may differ from adults.<h4>Purpose</h4>The aim of this study is to analyse the frequency, clinical picture and outcome of COVID-19 in children based on the experience from the tertiary care centre and regional sanitary-epidemiological office.<h4>Methods</h4>We report a study regarding 106 cases of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in PCR from a nasopharyngeal swab (age range 1-month - 17-years). In all cases, history was taken. In children who required hospital admission, physical examination and laboratory test were performed according to clinical indications.<h4>Results</h4>Twelve of the patients required admission to the hospital. The most common symptoms were anosmia and dysgeusia (75%) and headaches (49%) in outpatients and fever in hospitalised children (75%). Three children from the hospitalised group developed a severe course with increased inflammatory indexes. The clinical picture was more severe in younger children from the hospitalised group. Treatment options were regarded individually in all cases.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our study is the first tour knowledge regarding the clinical course of COVID-19 in Polish children. In general, the clinical course of COVID-19 was mild with anosmia and dysgeusia as the most common symptoms. However, in hospitalised children, a severe progression of the disease and less typical signs as aplastic anaemia may be developed.",0.6828116774559021,True

The aims of this study were to investigate (1) the cumulative risks of shunt revision (SR) and mortality and (2) the potential associations between prematurity, low weight for gestational age (LWGA), underlying aetiology, sex, age of the child at shunt placement, and the risk of SR.<h4>Method</h4>This was a purely register-based cohort study including all shunted hydrocephalic infants in Denmark 1996-2015. The cumulative risks of SR and mortality were estimated using the Aalen-Johansen and Kaplan-Meier estimators, respectively. A multivariable Cox-regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for SR according to the listed patient-related risk factors.<h4>Results</h4>Among 374 shunted infantile hydrocephalus patients accounting for 1047 SRs, the 3-month and 1-year cumulative risks of SR were 36% and 50%, respectively. The overall 10-year cumulative mortality was 12%, and for non-tumour subgroups 7-16% (isolated hydrocephalus 7%). The 10-year cumulative mortality for children born with LWGA was 21%. Except for aetiology, we observed no strong overall associations between the investigated risk factors and the risk of SR but interaction analyses for aetiology showed that patients with Dandy-Walker malformation born with LWGA had a higher risk of SR compared to patients of similar aetiology with normal WGA (HR 2.47, 95% CI: 1.39-4.40).<h4>Conclusions</h4>We found very high cumulative risks of SR and mortality among this youngest group of hydrocephalus patients, disregarding aetiology, but none of them were strongly related to the investigated risk factors.",0.6673448085784912,True
Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type 2,31302675,"Epilepsy is common in early childhood. In this age group it is associated with high rates of therapy-resistance, and with cognitive, motor, and behavioural comorbidity. A large number of genes, with wide ranging functions, are implicated in its aetiology, especially in those with therapy-resistant seizures. Identifying the more common single-gene epilepsies will aid in targeting resources, the prioritization of diagnostic testing and development of precision therapy. Previous studies of genetic testing in epilepsy have not been prospective and population-based. Therefore, the population-incidence of common genetic epilepsies remains unknown. The objective of this study was to describe the incidence and phenotypic spectrum of the most common single-gene epilepsies in young children, and to calculate what proportion are amenable to precision therapy. This was a prospective national epidemiological cohort study. All children presenting with epilepsy before 36 months of age were eligible. Children presenting with recurrent prolonged (>10 min) febrile seizures; febrile or afebrile status epilepticus (>30 min); or with clusters of two or more febrile or afebrile seizures within a 24-h period were also eligible. Participants were recruited from all 20 regional paediatric departments and four tertiary children's hospitals in Scotland over a 3-year period. DNA samples were tested on a custom-designed 104-gene epilepsy panel. Detailed clinical information was systematically gathered at initial presentation and during follow-up. Clinical and genetic data were reviewed by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians and genetic scientists. The pathogenic significance of the genetic variants was assessed in accordance with the guidelines of UK Association of Clinical Genetic Science (ACGS). Of the 343 patients who met inclusion criteria, 333 completed genetic testing, and 80/333 (24%) had a diagnostic genetic finding. The overall estimated annual incidence of single-gene epilepsies in this well-defined population was 1 per 2120 live births (47.2/100 000; 95% confidence interval 36.9-57.5). PRRT2 was the most common single-gene epilepsy with an incidence of 1 per 9970 live births (10.0/100 000; 95% confidence interval 5.26-14.8) followed by SCN1A: 1 per 12 200 (8.26/100 000; 95% confidence interval 3.93-12.6); KCNQ2: 1 per 17 000 (5.89/100 000; 95% confidence interval 2.24-9.56) and SLC2A1: 1 per 24 300 (4.13/100 000; 95% confidence interval 1.07-7.19). Presentation before the age of 6 months, and presentation with afebrile focal seizures were significantly associated with genetic diagnosis. Single-gene disorders accounted for a quarter of the seizure disorders in this cohort. Genetic testing is recommended to identify children who may benefit from precision treatment and should be mainstream practice in early childhood onset epilepsy.",0.667224645614624,True
Reactive angioendotheliomatosis,33621236,"CT-based quantitative analysis of any ossification center in the cranium has not previously been carried out due to the limited availability of human fetal material. Detailed morphometric data on the development of ossification centers in the human fetus may be useful in the early detection of congenital defects. Ossification disorders in the cranium are associated with either a delayed development of ossification centers or their mineralization. These aberrations may result in the formation of accessory skull bones that differ in shape and size, and the incidence of which may be misdiagnosed as, e.g., skull fractures. The study material comprised 37 human fetuses of both sexes (16♂, 21♀) aged 18-30 weeks. Using CT, digital image analysis software, 3D reconstruction and statistical methods, the linear, planar and spatial dimensions of the occipital squama ossification center were measured. The morphometric characteristics of the fused ossification center of the occipital squama show no right-left differences. In relation to gestational age, the ossification center of the occipital squama grows linearly in its right and left vertical diameters, logarithmically in its transverse diameters of both the interparietal and supraoccipital parts and projection surface area, and according to a quadratic function in its volume. The obtained numerical findings of the occipital squama ossification center may be considered age-specific references of relevance in both the estimation of gestational age and the diagnostic process of congenital defects.",0.6643849611282349,True
"Trigonobrachycephaly, bulbous bifid nose, micrognathia, and abnormalities of the hands and feet",34000089,"COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) represents a prothrombotic disorder, and there have been several reports of platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies being present in COVID-19-infected patients. This has thus been identified in some publications as representing a high incidence of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), whereas in others, findings have been tempered by general lack of functional reactivity using confirmation assays of serotonin release assay (SRA) or heparin-induced platelet aggregation (HIPA). Moreover, in at least two publications, data are provided suggesting that antibodies can arise in heparin naïve patients or that platelet activation may not be heparin-dependent. From this literature, we would conclude that platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies can be observed in COVID-19-infected patients, and they may occur at higher incidence than in historical non-COVID-19-infected cohorts. However, the situation is complex, since not all platelet factor 4/heparin antibodies may lead to platelet activation, and not all identified antibodies are heparin-dependent, such that they do not necessarily reflect ""true"" HIT. Most recently, a ""HIT-like"" syndrome has reported in patients who have been vaccinated against COVID-19.

Odontogenic myxoma,21091279,"<h4>Background</h4>Antiretroviral chemoprophylaxis before exposure is a promising approach for the prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition.<h4>Methods</h4>We randomly assigned 2499 HIV-seronegative men or transgender women who have sex with men to receive a combination of two oral antiretroviral drugs, emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC-TDF), or placebo once daily. All subjects received HIV testing, risk-reduction counseling, condoms, and management of sexually transmitted infections.<h4>Results</h4>The study subjects were followed for 3324 person-years (median, 1.2 years; maximum, 2.8 years). Of these subjects, 10 were found to have been infected with HIV at enrollment, and 100 became infected during follow-up (36 in the FTC-TDF group and 64 in the placebo group), indicating a 44% reduction in the incidence of HIV (95% confidence interval, 15 to 63; P=0.005). In the FTC-TDF group, the study drug was detected in 22 of 43 of seronegative subjects (51%) and in 3 of 34 HIV-infected subjects (9%) (P<0.001). Nausea was reported more frequently during the first 4 weeks in the FTC-TDF group than in the placebo group (P<0.001).

5q14.3 microdeletion syndrome ,27344647,"<h4>Background</h4>The state of newborn screening (NBS) programmes for organic acidurias in Europe was assessed by a web-based questionnaire in the EU programme of Community Action in Public Health 2010/2011 among the - at that time - 27 EU member states, candidate countries, potential candidates and three EFTA countries.<h4>Results</h4>Thirty-seven data sets from 39 target countries were analysed. Newborn screening for glutaric aciduria type I (GA-I) was performed in ten, for isovaleric aciduria (IVA) in nine and for methylmalonic aciduria including cblA, cblB, cblC and cblD (MMACBL) as well as for propionic aciduria (PA) in seven countries. Samples were obtained at a median age of 2.5 days and laboratory analysis began at median age of 4.5 days. Positive screening results were mostly confirmed in specialised centres by analysis of organic acids in urine. Confirmation of a positive screening result usually did not start before the second week of life (median ages: 9.5 days [IVA], 9 days [GA-I], 8.5 days [PA, MMACBL]) and was completed early in the third week of life (median ages: 15 days [IVA, PA, MMA], 14.5 days [GA-I]). Treatment was initiated in GA-I and IVA at a median age of 14 days and in MMACBL and PA at a median age of 15 days.<h4>Conclusion</h4>NBS for organic acidurias in Europe is variable and less often established than for amino acid disorders.

Lissencephaly X-linked,32319733,"<h4>Background</h4>The VACTERL association (VACTERL) is the nonrandom occurrence of at least three of these congenital anomalies: vertebral, anal, cardiac, tracheoesophageal, renal, and limb anomalies. Despite suggestions for involvement of several genes and nongenetic risk factors from small studies, the etiology of VACTERL remains largely unknown.<h4>Objective</h4>To identify maternal risk factors for VACTERL in offspring in a large European study.<h4>Methods</h4>A case-control study was performed using data from 28 EUROCAT registries over the period 1997-2015 with case and control ascertainment through hospital records, birth and death certificates, questionnaires, and/or postmortem examinations. Cases were diagnosed with VACTERL, while controls had a genetic syndrome and/or chromosomal abnormality. Data collected included type of birth defect and maternal characteristics, such as age, use of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), and chronic illnesses. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to estimate confounder adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).<h4>Results</h4>The study population consisted of 329 VACTERL cases and 49,724 controls with recognized syndromes or chromosomal abnormality. For couples who conceived through ART, we found an increased risk of VACTERL (aOR 2.3 [95% CI 1.3, 3.9]) in offspring. Pregestational diabetes (aOR 3.1 [95% CI 1.1, 8.6]) and chronic lower obstructive pulmonary diseases (aOR 3.9 [95% CI 2.2, 6.7]) also increased the risk of having a child with VACTERL. Twin pregnancies were not associated with VACTERL (aOR 0.6 [95% CI 0.3, 1.4]).<h4>Conclusion</h4>We identified several maternal risk factors for VACTERL in offspring befitting a multifactorial etiology.",0.6500219106674194,True
X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 3,33576939,"<h4>Objectives</h4>The objective of our study was to conduct a systematic literature review of estimates of costs of illness of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).<h4>Methods</h4>We searched MEDLINE (through PubMed), CINAHL, Embase, Web of Science, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, and the National Health Service Health Technology Assessment Database for studies published from inception up until 31 August, 2020, reporting direct medical, direct non-medical, and/or indirect costs of any phenotype of SMA. Two reviewers independently screened records for eligibility, extracted the data, and assessed studies for risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Costs were adjusted and converted to 2018 US dollars.<h4>Results</h4>The search identified 14 studies from eight countries (Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, the UK, and the USA). The mean per-patient annual direct medical cost of illness was estimated at between $3320 (SMA type III, Italy) and $324,410 (SMA type I, USA), mean per-patient annual direct non-medical cost between $25,880 (SMA types I-III, Spain) and $136,800 (SMA type I, Sweden), and mean per-patient annual indirect cost between $9440 (SMA type I, Germany) and $74,910 (SMA type II, Australia). Most studies exhibited a risk of bias.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The current body of evidence of costs of illness of SMA is relatively scarce and characterized by considerable variability across geographical settings and disease phenotypes. Our review provides data pertaining to the economic impact of SMA, which is of particular relevance in light of emerging treatments and ongoing research in this field, and underscores the substantial unmet medical need in this patient population.",0.6498574614524841,True

Factor X deficiency,32577727,"<h4>Background and aims</h4>Hybanthus austrocaledonicus (Violaceae) is a nickel (Ni) hyperaccumulator endemic to New Caledonia. One of the specimens stored at the local herbarium had a strip of bark with a remarkably green phloem tissue attached to the sheet containing over 4 wt% Ni. This study aimed to collect field samples from the original H. austrocaledonicus locality to confirm the nature of the green 'nickel-rich phloem' in this taxon and to systematically assess the occurrence of Ni hyperaccumulation in H. austrocaledonicus and Hybanthus caledonicus populations.<h4>Methods</h4>X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy scanning of all collections of the genus Hybanthus (236 specimens) was undertaken at the Herbarium of New Caledonia to reveal incidences of Ni accumulation in populations of H. austrocaledonicus and H. caledonicus. In parallel, micro-analytical investigations were performed via synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) and scanning electron microscopy with X-ray microanalysis (SEM-EDS).<h4>Key results</h4>The extensive scanning demonstrated that Ni hyperaccumulation is not a characteristic common to all populations in the endemic Hybanthus species. Synchrotron XFM revealed that Ni was exclusively concentrated in the epidermal cells of the leaf blade and petiole, conforming with the majority of (tropical) Ni hyperaccumulator plants studied to date. SEM-EDS of freeze-dried and frozen-hydrated samples revealed the presence of dense solid deposits in the phloem bundles that contained >8 wt% nickel.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The occurrence of extremely Ni-rich green phloem tissues appears to be a characteristic feature of tropical Ni hyperaccumulator plants.",0.6454440355300903,True

We have observed this disorder in two Norwegian brothers. Genome-wide screening in the two families, followed by saturation marker studies and linkage analysis, identified a 1.4-Mb homozygous candidate region on chromosome 19p12. The maximum multipoint LOD score was 4.22. In both families, DNA sequencing of 25 genes within the candidate region identified potentially deleterious CRLF1 sequence variants that were not found in unaffected control individuals. Our findings confirm that the cold-induced sweating syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder that is probably caused by impaired function of the CRLF1 gene, and they suggest important developmental functions for human CRLF1.",0.6164100170135498,True
Amebiasis,24731844,"<h4>Background</h4>To evaluate clinical, genetic, and radiologic features of our patients with muscle-eye-brain disease.<h4>Methods</h4>The data of patients who were diagnosed with muscle-eye-brain disease from a cohort of patients with congenital muscular dystrophy in the Division of Pediatric Neurology of Dokuz Eylül University School of Medicine and Gaziantep Children's Hospital between 2005 and 2013 were analyzed retrospectively.<h4>Results</h4>From a cohort of 34 patients with congenital muscular dystrophy, 12 patients from 10 families were diagnosed with muscle-eye-brain disease. The mean age of the patients was 9 ± 5.5 years (2-19 years). Mean serum creatine kinase value was 2485.80 ± 1308.54 IU/L (700-4267 IU/L). All patients presented with muscular hypotonia at birth followed by varying degrees of spasticity and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes in later stages of life. Three patients were able to walk. The most common ophthalmologic and radiologic abnormalities were cataracts, retinal detachment, periventricular white matter abnormalities, ventriculomegaly, pontocerebellar hypoplasia, and multiple cerebellar cysts. All of the patients had mutations in the POMGNT1 gene. The most common mutation detected in 66% of patients was c.1814 G > A (p.R605H). Two novel mutations were identified.<h4>Conclusions</h4>We suggest that muscle-eye-brain disease is a relatively common muscular dystrophy in Turkey. It should be suspected in patients with muscular hypotonia, increased creatine kinase, and structural eye and brain abnormalities. The c.1814 G > A mutation in exon 21 of the POMGNT1 gene is apparently a common mutation in the Turkish population. Individuals with this mutation show classical features of muscle-eye-brain disease, but others may exhibit a milder phenotype and retain the ability to walk independently.

"Dendritic cell, monocyte, B lymphocyte, and natural killer lymphocyte deficiency",32922824,"<h4>Background</h4>The degenerative cerebellar ataxias comprise a large and heterogeneous group of neurological diseases whose hallmark clinical feature is ataxia, and which are accompanied, to variable degrees, by other features that are attributable to cerebellar dysfunction. Essential tremor (ET) is an exceptionally common neurological disease whose primary motor feature is action tremor, although patients often manifest intention tremor, mild gait ataxia and several other features of cerebellar dysfunction.<h4>Main body</h4>In this paper, we review the abundant evidence derived from clinical, neuroimaging and postmortem studies, linking ET to cerebellar dysfunction. Furthermore, we review the combination of clinical, natural history and postmortem features suggesting that ET is neurodegenerative. We then compare the prevalence of ET (400 - 900 cases per 100,000) to that of the other cerebellar degenerations (ranging from <0.5 - 9 cases per 100,000, and in composite likely to be on the order of 20 cases per 100,000) and conclude that ET is 20 to 45 times more prevalent than all other forms of cerebellar degeneration combined.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Given the data we present, it is logical to conclude that ET is, by far, the most common form of cerebellar degeneration.",0.6087387204170227,True

However, the electrophysiological features are seldom reported. <b>Methods:</b> We reviewed and analyzed published reports to determine the electrophysiological features of CMTX1 patients with transient central nervous system deficits. <b>Results:</b> A total of 21 CMTX1 patients with transient central nervous system deficits were found in 17 published case reports/series. The age of onset ranged from 0.5 to 18 years (mean 12.02 ± 0.78 years). All patients were male. Recurrent episodes of central nervous system deficits were reported in all 21 cases and resolved in periods ranging from several minutes to 3 days. All 20 patients who had MRIs at presentation had bilaterally symmetrical abnormal T2/Diffusion signals in the white matter without enhancement of gadolinium. All subsequent MRIs showed improvement or were within normal limits. The median motor nerve conduction velocity (MNCV), motor latencies, and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude were the most commonly measurable electrophysiological parameters (85.7%). All cases that had MNCV at presentation had slower and significantly decreased MNCV compared with the normal value (34.1 ± 1.10 m/s vs. 46.8±2.05 m/s, <i>P</i> < 0.0001; 95% CI, -17.4 to -7.92).

Craniosynostosis arthrogryposis cleft palate,33435522,"Mitochondria are ubiquitous intracellular organelles found in almost all eukaryotes and involved in various aspects of cellular life, with a primary role in energy production. The interest in this organelle has grown stronger with the discovery of their link to various pathologies, including cancer, aging and neurodegenerative diseases. Indeed, dysfunctional mitochondria cannot provide the required energy to tissues with a high-energy demand, such as heart, brain and muscles, leading to a large spectrum of clinical phenotypes. Mitochondrial defects are at the origin of a group of clinically heterogeneous pathologies, called mitochondrial diseases, with an incidence of 1 in 5000 live births. Primary mitochondrial diseases are associated with genetic mutations both in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), affecting genes involved in every aspect of the organelle function. As a consequence, it is difficult to find a common cause for mitochondrial diseases and, subsequently, to offer a precise clinical definition of the pathology.

Cyclosporine may have therapeutic role in active vitiligo but current evidence supporting its role is scarce. The objective of study was to compare the efficacy and safety of oral cyclosporine with OMP in patients of active vitiligo. Fifty patients with active vitiligo were randomized into two groups of 25 patients. Group 1 was treated with OMP (2.5 mg dexamethasone) on two consecutive days/week for 4 months while group 2 was treated with cyclosporine (3 mg/kg/day) for 4 months. Laboratory monitoring was performed as per the prevalent protocol. The patients were followed up for another 2 months after stopping treatment. Arrest of disease progression (ADP) was defined as change of vitiligo disease activity score from 4+ to 3+ (time elapsed since last disease activity being more than 6 weeks upto 3 months) during the study period (6 months). ADP was attained in 21 patients in group 1 and 22 patients in group 2 (84% vs. 88%, p = 1.00) at the end of 6 months. However, mean time to achieve ADP was significantly lower in group 2 as compared to group 1 (10.92 [4.12] weeks vs. 13.90 [3.92] weeks, p = 0.01). Extent of repigmentation, improvement in patient assessment score, vitiligo quality of life and clinical markers of disease activity were marginal and comparable in both groups.

CAs were defined as any major structural or chromosomal abnormality, or a cluster of 2 or more minor abnormalities, according to the conventions of the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry. CAs were identified from fetal ultrasound, study visit, and death reports. Prevalence rates [number of CAs per 100 live births (LBs)] were calculated for specific ARVs, classes of ARVs, and overall exposure to ARVs.<h4>Results</h4>Of 1229 women enrolled, 995 pregnancy outcomes (974 LBs) met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 60 infants (59 LBs and 1 stillbirth) had at least 1 CA. The overall prevalence of CAs (per 100 LBs) was 6.2 [95% confidence interval (CI) 4.6 to 7.7]. The prevalence of CAs after first trimester ARVs (6.2; 95% CI 3.1 to 9.3) was similar to that after second (6.8; 95% CI 4.5 to 9.0) or third trimester (4.3; 95% CI 1.5 to 7.2) exposure. The rate of CAs identified within 7 days of delivery was 2.36 (95% CI 1.4 to 3.3).<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prevalence of CAs after first trimester exposure to ARVs was similar to that after second or third trimester exposure.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the pathophysiology during the early stage of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction by the quantitative proteome analysis of human myocardium.<h4>Methods</h4>Among 331 post-mortem autopsy patients, we selected 23 patients (aged 79 ± 9.6 years) with echocardiographic data and without major comorbidities, except hypertension. Cryopreserved autopsy tissue of the LV myocardium was subjected to proteome analysis. LV diastolic function was evaluated by echocardiographic data. Thirteen patients were classified into the impaired diastolic function (IDF) group, and 10 the normal cardiac function group. We performed comparative proteome analysis between the IDF and normal groups by isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) using nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.<h4>Results</h4>The iTRAQ-based proteome analysis revealed 57 differentially expressed proteins in the IDF group. Molecular network analysis of differentially expressed proteins indicated that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was a potentially important event. Furthermore, the expressions of proteins associated with the ER stress response, such as glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa, inositol-requiring kinase 1α and spliced X-box binding protein 1, were significantly decreased in the IDF group.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This study suggested that reduced ER stress responses were involved during the early stage of LV diastolic dysfunction.

Immunological involvement remains a largely uncharted topic in CDG, mainly due to lack of robust data. To better characterize immune-related manifestations' prevalence, relevance, and quality-of-life (QoL) impact, we developed electronic questionnaires targeting (1) CDG patients and (2) the general ""healthy"" population. Two-hundred and nine CDG patients/caregivers and 349 healthy participants were included in this study. PMM2-CDG was the most represented CDG (n = 122/209). About half of these participants (n = 65/122) described relevant infections with a noteworthy prevalence of those affecting the gastrointestinal tract (GI) (63.1%, n = 41/65). Infection burden and QoL impact were shown as infections correlated with more severe clinical phenotypes and with a set of relevant non-immune PMM2-CDG signs. Autoimmune diseases had only a marginal presence in PMM2-CDG (2.5%, n = 3/122), all being GI-related. Allergy prevalence was also low in PMM2-CDG (33%, n = 41/122) except for food allergies (26.8%, n = 11/41, of PMM2-CDG and 10.8%, n = 17/158, of controls). High vaccination compliance with greater perceived ineffectiveness (28.3%, n = 17/60) and more severe adverse reactions were described in PMM2-CDG.

Spastic paraplegia 2,33007500,"<h4>Background</h4>Primary immune deficiencies (PIDs) are a heterogeneous group of disorders resulting from defects in immune system. They lead to increased susceptibility to infections and immune dysregulation. The resulting chronic inflammation can induce long-term complications, including AA amyloidosis (AAA).<h4>Objectives</h4>To present the French cases of PID-related AAA and perform a systematic literature review to determine its main features and predisposing factors.<h4>Methods</h4>A systematic literature review was performed by searching MEDLINE up until 2019. New French cases were identified with the help of the Reference Center for Auto-Inflammatory Diseases and AA Amyloidosis and the Reference Center for Hereditary Immune Deficiencies.<h4>Results</h4>Forty patients were identified including 2 new French cases. PIDs were varied: immunoglobulin deficits (n = 30), chronic granulomatous disease (n = 3), hyper-IgM syndrome (n = 3), hereditary complete C4 deficiency (n = 1), leucocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (n = 1), hyper-IgE syndrome (n = 1), and Chediak-Higashi syndrome (n = 1). The mean age at PID diagnosis was 22.2 ± 16.02 years. Renal involvement was the most common manifestation of AAA (80%). Infections were extremely heterogeneous; bacterial infection with pulmonary involvement was the most frequent. Bronchiectasis was particularly common (52.5%). The delay between the first symptoms of PID and AAA diagnosis was 16.18 ± 7 years. Thirteen concomitant diagnoses were made.

Human T-cell leukemia virus type 2,31918158,"BACKGROUND:Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare endocrine malignancy, often with an unfavorable prognosis. Radical adrenalectomy is the gold standard of treatment of localized disease. CASE DESCRIPTION:We report a case of a 23-year-old male patient who presented with persistent left flank pain and urticaria for 3 months. Imaging studies confirmed the presence of a large left adrenal mass with malignant features. The biochemical workup was unremarkable. Open left radical adrenalectomy was performed, the final pathologic examination showed ACC with negative surgical margins. The patient remained disease-free for eighteen months period of follow up after surgery. DISCUSSION:ACC is a rare neoplasm with poor prognosis and with an incidence of one in one million population. There is a slight female predilection. The ACC may be functional with a clinically pure endocrine syndrome like Cushing syndrome. Most of patients with ACC present with symptoms and signs of hormonal secretion. Adrenal computed tomography (CT) scanning and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are the imaging studies of choice in ACC. When feasible, total resection remains the treatment of choice for the definitive treatment of ACC. The benefit of the use of mitotane as an adjuvant treatment has been considered controversial. Adjuvant mitotane significantly decreases the recurrence and mortality rate after resection of ACC in patients without distant metastasis as proved by some studies, but these findings need further validation.

Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis,33526985,"<b>Background:</b> Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a rare disease characterized by increased bone fragility and susceptibility for fractures. Only few studies have compared the management for femoral fractures in children with OI. Nevertheless, no cohort studies have described the treatment for femoral fractures in adults with OI in Taiwan. This study aimed to investigate and compare the incidence of union and non-union femoral fractures and the best treatment options to avoid non-union fractures. <b>Methods:</b> We enrolled 72 patients with OI who were older than 18 years at MacKay Memorial Hospital between January 2010 and December 2018. Femoral fracture incidence, non-union rate, and treatment modality were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Of 72 patients with OI, 11 patients had femoral fractures and 4 patients of them had >1 femoral fracture. The incidence for all types of femoral fractures was 651 fractures per 100,000 person-years annually.

"Cutis laxa, autosomal dominant",30666988,"The hierarchical information flow through DNA-RNA-protein-metabolite collectively referred to as 'molecular fingerprint' defines both health and disease. Environment and food (quality and quantity) are the key factors known to affect the health of an individual. The fundamental concepts are that the transition from a healthy condition to a disease phenotype must occur by concurrent alterations in the genome expression or by differences in protein synthesis, function and metabolites. In other words, the dietary components directly or indirectly modulate the molecular fingerprint and understanding of which is dealt with nutrigenomics. Although the fundamental principles of nutrigenomics remain similar to that of traditional research, a collection of comprehensive targeted/untargeted data sets in the context of nutrition offers the unique advantage of understanding complex metabolic networks to provide a mechanistic understanding of data from epidemiological and intervention studies. In this review the challenges and opportunities of nutrigenomic tools in addressing the nutritional problems of public health importance are discussed. The application of nutrigenomic tools provided numerous leads on biomarkers of nutrient intake, undernutrition, metabolic syndrome and its complications. Importantly, nutrigenomic studies also led to the discovery of the association of multiple genetic polymorphisms in relation to the variability of micronutrient absorption and metabolism, providing a potential opportunity for further research toward setting personalized dietary recommendations for individuals and population subgroups.",0.5549472570419312,True
Brachycephalofrontonasal dysplasia,33073017,"Georgia uses post-analytical tools through Collaborative Laboratory Integrated Reports (CLIR) to triage abnormal newborn screening (NBS) results for follow-up. Condition specific tools are used to assign each case a risk level, which is used to guide follow-up recommendations. Follow-up recommendations include assessment by the child's primary care provider as well as testing, either a repeat NBS or confirmatory testing. Triaging abnormal cases using these tools has been advantageous in managing the workflow for the follow-up team, as well as prioritizing cases that appropriately require more attention and resources. The initial goal in utilizing these tools was to reduce the amount of confirmatory testing, particularly for disorders where there are many false positives. We assessed the performance of these tools retrospectively for three of the most commonly detected conditions by tandem mass spectrometry in Georgia: phenylketonuria, medium chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency and very long chain dehydrogenase deficiency. The post-analytical tools appropriately assigned all true positive cases to the higher levels of follow-up testing and reduced the level of intervention for a significant number of cases as well. Based on the experience gained from our utilization of the tools in the follow-up program, we are well situated to move forward with using the tools in a more prospective manner, and reduce the number of cases that will be reported, rather than just assigning resources appropriately at follow-up. Post-analytical tools are an improvement over trying to capture the variation in the newborn population using multiple cutoffs. It also easily identifies significant abnormalities that are unrelated to inherited disease, such as large amino acid elevations due to total parenteral nutrition.",0.5478175282478333,True
Adnexal spiradenoma/cylindroma of a sweat gland,32685352,"Lysosomal disorders are diseases that involve mutations in genes responsible for the coding of lysosomal enzymes, transport proteins, activator proteins and protein processing enzymes. These defects lead to the storage of specific metabolites within lysosomes resulting in a great variety of clinical features depending on the tissues with the storage, the storage products and the extent of the storage. The methods for rapidly diagnosing patients started in the late 1960's when the enzyme defects were identified eliminating the need for tissue biopsies. The first requests for diagnostic help in this laboratory came in 1973. In that year, patients with Krabbe disease and Niemann-Pick type A were diagnosed. Since that time samples from about 62 000 individuals have been received for diagnostic studies, and 4900 diagnoses have been made. The largest number of diagnosed individuals had metachromatic leukodystrophy and Krabbe disease because of our research interest in leukodystrophies. A number of new disorders were identified and the primary defects in other disorders were clarified. With new methods for diagnosis, including newborn screening, molecular analysis, microarrays, there is still a need for biochemical confirmation before treatment is considered. With new treatments, including gene therapy, stem cell transplantation, enzyme replacement used alone or in combination becoming more available, the need for rapid, accurate diagnosis is critical.",0.536533534526825,True
Hypochondroplasia,31527509,"Tight junctions are cellular junctions that play a major role in the epithelial barrier function. In the inner ear, claudins, occludin, tricellulin, and angulins form the bicellular or tricellular binding of membrane proteins. In these, one type of claudin gene, <i>CLDN14</i>, was reported to be responsible for human hereditary hearing loss, DFNB29. Until now, nine pathogenic variants have been reported, and most phenotypic features remain unclear. In the present study, genetic screening for 68 previously reported deafness causative genes was carried out to identify <i>CLDN14</i> variants in a large series of Japanese hearing loss patients, and to clarify the prevalence and clinical characteristics of DFNB29 in the Japanese population. One patient had a homozygous novel variant (c.241C>T: p.Arg81Cys) (0.04%: 1/2549). The patient showed progressive bilateral hearing loss, with post-lingual onset. Pure-tone audiograms indicated a high-frequency hearing loss type, and the deterioration gradually spread to other frequencies. The patient showed normal vestibular function. Cochlear implantation improved the patient's sound field threshold levels, but not speech discrimination scores. This report indicated that claudin-14 is essential for maintaining the inner ear environment and suggested the possible phenotypic expansion of DFNB29. This is the first report of a patient with a tight junction variant receiving a cochlear implantation.",0.5239110589027405,True

We measured anti-HTLV-1 antibodies among Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors to determine whether HTLV-1 is related to RA and whether radiation exposure is associated with HTLV-1 and RA prevalence.This is a cross-sectional study among atomic bomb survivors who participated in biennial health examinations from 2006 to 2010. Serum levels of anti-HTLV-1 antibodies were measured using a chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay and confirmed by Western blotting. Association between HTLV-1 and RA was analyzed by a logistic regression model.Of 2091 participants (women 61.5%; median age, 73 years), 215 (10.3%) had anti-HTLV-1 antibodies. HTLV-1 prevalence was higher among women (13.1% vs 5.8%; P < .001). Twenty-two participants (1.1%) were diagnosed with RA. HTLV-1 prevalence among RA participants was significantly higher than that among non-RA participants (27.3% vs 10.1%; P = .020). After adjustment for age, sex, and hepatitis C virus infection, HTLV-1 was significantly associated with prevalent RA (odds ratio, 2.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.06, 7.03).

Muscle eye brain disease,31344241,"<h4>Background and objective</h4>To understand the microvascular abnormalities in cystoid macular edema (CME) in gyrate atrophy.<h4>Patients and methods</h4>Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) were used in four consecutive female patients (eight eyes) with clinically and biochemistry-confirmed cases of gyrate atrophy and associated CME. Foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area and macular vessel density percentage were calculated and compared with normal subjects.<h4>Results</h4>The average age was 20 years (range: 13 years to 32 years). The mean refractive error was -6.5 diopters (D) (range: -1.0 D to -11.0 D). The average central macular thickness was 509 μm (range: 291 μm to 750 μm). OCTA showed an enlarged FAZ in the deep capillary plexus (DCP) with presence of hyporeflective cysts in both the superficial and deep capillary layers corresponding to CME. Compared to the normal subjects, the mean FAZ area was enlarged and macular vessel density was reduced in both the superficial capillary plexus and DCP; this was statistically significant (P < .05). En face OCT of the DCPs showed classical hyporeflective honeycomb pattern delineating the structural pattern of CME in the inner plexiform and outer plexiform layer.<h4>Conclusion</h4>OCTA helps understand the basic pathophysiologic mechanisms in gyrate atrophy of choroid as well as etiology for CME and macular schisis.

Enchondromatosis dwarfism deafness,32355641,"Anticancer drug nephrotoxicity is an important and increasing adverse drug event that limits the efficacy of cancer treatment. The kidney is an important elimination pathway for many antineoplastic drugs and their metabolites, which occurs by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Chemotherapeutic agents, both conventional cytotoxic agents and molecularly targeted agents, can affect any segment of the nephron including its microvasculature, leading to many clinical manifestations such as proteinuria, hypertension, electrolyte disturbances, glomerulopathy, acute and chronic interstitial nephritis, acute kidney injury and at times chronic kidney disease. The clinician should be alert to recognize several factors that may maximize renal dysfunction and contribute to the increased incidence of nephrotoxicity associated with these drugs, such as intravascular volume depletion, the associated use of nonchemotherapeutic nephrotoxic drugs (analgesics, antibiotics, proton pump inhibitors, and bone-targeted therapies), radiographic ionic contrast media or radiation therapy, urinary tract obstruction, and intrinsic renal disease. Identification of patients at higher risk for nephrotoxicity may allow the prevention or at least reduction in the development and severity of this adverse effect. Therefore, the aim of this brief review is to provide currently available evidences on oncologic drug-related nephrotoxicity.",0.5122635364532471,True
Severe congenital neutropenia autosomal dominant,33554218,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is emerging as the greatest public health crisis in the early 21<sup>st</sup>century. Its causative agent, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is an enveloped single stranded positive-sense ribonucleic acid virus that enters cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor or several other receptors. While COVID-19 primarily affects the respiratory system, other organs including the brain can be involved. In Western clinical studies, relatively mild neurological dysfunction such as anosmia and dysgeusia is frequent (~70-84%) while severe neurologic disorders such as stroke (~1-6%) and meningoencephalitis are less common. It is unclear how much SARS-CoV-2 infection contributes to the incidence of stroke given co-morbidities in the affected patient population. Rarely, clinically-defined cases of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, Guillain-Barré syndrome and acute necrotizing encephalopathy have been reported in COVID-19 patients. Common neuropathological findings in the 184 patients reviewed include microglial activation (42.9%) with microglial nodules in a subset (33.3%), lymphoid inflammation (37.5%), acute hypoxic-ischemic changes (29.9%), astrogliosis (27.7%), acute/subacute brain infarcts (21.2%), spontaneous hemorrhage (15.8%), and microthrombi (15.2%). In our institutional cases, we also note occasional anterior pituitary infarcts. COVID-19 coagulopathy, sepsis, and acute respiratory distress likely contribute to a number of these findings. When present, central nervous system lymphoid inflammation is often minimal to mild, is detected best by immunohistochemistry and, in one study, indistinguishable from control sepsis cases. Some cases evince microglial nodules or neuronophagy, strongly supporting viral meningoencephalitis, with a proclivity for involvement of the medulla oblongata. The virus is detectable by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, or electron microscopy in human cerebrum, cerebellum, cranial nerves, olfactory bulb, as well as in the olfactory epithelium; neurons and endothelium can also be infected. Review of the extant cases has limitations including selection bias and limited clinical information in some cases. Much remains to be learned about the effects of direct viral infection of brain cells and whether SARS-CoV-2 persists long-term contributing to chronic symptomatology.",0.5112043619155884,True
Palindromic rheumatism,33780753,"To date, retinal implants are the only available treatment for blind individuals with retinal degenerations such as retinitis pigmentosa. Argus II is the only visual implant with FDA approval, with more than 300 users worldwide. Argus II stimulation is based on a grayscale image coming from a head-mounted visible-light camera. Normally, the 11<sup>°</sup>×19<sup>°</sup> field of view of the Argus II user is full of objects that may elicit similar phosphenes. The prosthesis cannot meaningfully convey so much visual information, and the percept is reduced to an ambiguous impression of light. This study is aimed at investigating the efficacy of simplifying the video input in real-time using a heat-sensitive camera. Data were acquired from four Argus II users in 5 stationary tasks with either hot objects or human targets as stimuli. All tasks were of m-alternative forced choice design where precisely one of the m≥2 response alternatives was defined to be ""correct"" by the experimenter. To compare performance with heat-sensitive and normal cameras across all tasks, regardless of m, we used an extension of signal detection theory to latent variables, estimating person ability and item difficulty in d' units. Results demonstrate that subject performance was significantly better across all tasks with the thermal camera compared to the regular Argus II camera. The future addition of thermal imaging to devices with very poor spatial resolution may have significant real-life benefits for orientation, personal safety, and social interactions, thereby improving quality of life.",0.5008939504623413,True
